# Education

I completed my PhD in Geography in 2020, specializing in medical geography, public health, policy, environmental health, spatial analysis, statistics, and vulnerable populations. Prior to my doctoral studies, I also earned a master's degree in spatial analysis (2013) with a focus on medical geography, spatial analysis, and spatial statistics. During my time in graduate school, I gained a wealth of experience as a teaching assistant for a variety of courses at all levels, from introductory classes to advanced seminars. I have also worked as a research assistant on an active transportation study during my undergraduate years. With my extensive background in research, academic writing, spatial analysis, statistics and teaching, as well as my passion for medical geography, public health and vulnerable populations, I am well-equipped to contribute to any project.

**Dissertation**: [Identifying geographic areas where children may be at-risk of lead
poisoning and assessing the need for lead abatement in urban areas: a case study in
Hamilton, Ontario](https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/26011/2/mackay_kevin_p_finalsubmission202009_phd.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Thirty years since the removal of lead from gasoline, lead still poses a health risk.
Children are most at-risk for adverse health outcomes caused by lead toxicity due to both
behavioural (e.g., hand-to-mouth behaviour) and physiological differences (i.e., increased
intake of lead by body weight, higher uptake rate and a higher vulnerability to the effects
of lead) compared to adults (Yeoh et al., 2009). As a result, governments must identify
children that may be at-risk of lead poisoning and develop practical methods to mitigate
lead exposure.

Before a government can develop a policy to help mitigate exposure of lead for
children, we need to understand the spatial distribution of lead within the city. A popular
spatial model used within air pollution research may allow more accurate, and more
localized predictions than the most common interpolation method, kriging. Land use
regression (LUR) is a technique leveraging multiple predictor variables to help estimate
the spatial distribution of the dependent variable. By using historical sources of lead,
LUR can be used to model soil lead levels (SLL) with localized variation. Unfortunately,
spurious relationships can be the basis of a LUR model, which may lead to an overfitted
spatial model resulting in a model with little generalizability and questionable ability to
estimate the dependent variable at unobserved locations. Ultimately, Empirical Bayesian
Kriging may be the best option for soil contamination research due to its ability to
provide a smoothed prediction surface and its dependence on the spatial structure of the
data to provide estimations.

The benefit to society and the return on investment (ROI) is often the justification
for lead remediation. Gould (2009) estimates a $17 to $221 ROI for every dollar spent on
lead hazard control. One of the main components of this estimate of ROI comes from the
decrease in intelligence quotient (IQ) that a child may experience as a consequence of
lead toxicity. There are three main ways that a decrease in IQ can negatively impact the
economy, (i) lower potential lifetime earnings, (ii) reduced tax revenues, and (iii) higher
spending on special education (Gould, 2009). Since IQ has such a significant role in the
ROI estimates, chapter 3 seeks to achieve a greater understanding of the relationship
between blood lead levels (BLLs) and IQ. The loss of IQ points for an increase in blood
lead concentration proposed by Lanphear et al. (2005) and referenced by Gould (2009) is
significantly higher than what we found in our meta-analysis. Thus, the projected ROI
proposed by Gould (2009) may be much lower than previously calculated.

In the final chapter, the cost associated with permanent lead abatement is
investigated based on ROI projections as a case study in Hamilton, Ontario. We show
that, in most cases, permanent lead remediation is far too expensive for a municipal
government. Furthermore, the capital initially invested may not be distributed back into
the local economy, as the ROI suggests. We suggest that municipal governments make
decisions based on need, rather than basing remediation decisions on ROI projections.
Furthermore, we recommend the use of hazard quotient maps to help justify lead
remediation as a more accurate representation of potential lead toxicity, instead of only
looking at SLL exceedances across the city.

## **Master of Spatial Analysis**

**Thesis**: [The Effect of Occupation on the Spatial Distribution of HIV and Aids in Thailand Using Amoeba Cluster Analysis](https://www.torontomu.ca/spatial-analysis/requirements/major-research-paper-abstracts/mackay_kevin/)

**Abstract**:

HIV is a worldwide epidemic that affects millions of people. The purpose of this paper is to compare the spatial distribution of HIV and AIDS by occupation in Thailand. A new cluster analysis tool developed in 2006, AMOEBA, can be used identify local clusters that are typically irregularly- shaped within a study area. The AMOEBA tool will use the local Gi* statistic to classify a cluster of spatial units as lower or higher at a 0.05 confidence level. The outcome determined that the spatial distribution of HIV and AIDS for agricultural and non-agricultural groups were dependent on urbanity. Secondly, due to issues with no data, the spatial distribution of HIV and AIDS for the student occupation group could not be explained. As a result, the AMOEBA tool allowed new research questions to be developed.
