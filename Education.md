# Education

I completed my PhD in Geography in 2020, specializing in medical geography, public health, policy, environmental health, spatial analysis, statistics, and vulnerable populations. Prior to my doctoral studies, I also earned a master's degree in spatial analysis (2013) with a focus on medical geography, spatial analysis, and spatial statistics. During my time in graduate school, I gained a wealth of experience as a teaching assistant for a variety of courses at all levels, from introductory classes to advanced seminars. I have also worked as a research assistant on an active transportation study during my undergraduate years. With my extensive background in research, academic writing, spatial analysis, statistics and teaching, as well as my passion for medical geography, public health and vulnerable populations, I am well-equipped to contribute to any project.
