# Work With Me

I help organizations make sense of complex health, spatial, and administrative data by supporting the full lifecycle of analytical and research projects. Whether you need help defining a problem, improving data quality, conducting analysis, or communicating results, I bring structure, clarity, and rigor to every stage of the work.

## How I Can Help

### Full‑Lifecycle Analytical Support
I work across the entire analytics and research lifecycle—from requirements gathering and data validation to analysis, interpretation, and communication. I help teams move from uncertainty to clarity with solutions that are reliable, transparent, and future‑proof.

### Problem Definition & Scoping
I help teams clarify questions, identify constraints, and translate ideas into actionable analytical plans. This includes understanding stakeholder needs, assessing feasibility, and outlining the steps required to deliver meaningful results.

### Data Quality, Governance & Workflow Design
I specialize in validating data, documenting assumptions, and building reproducible workflows. My focus is on creating systems that are maintainable, trustworthy, and aligned with governance requirements.

### Analysis, Research & Insight Generation
I conduct spatial, statistical, and mixed‑methods analysis to support program monitoring, performance measurement, and policy‑oriented decision‑making. I translate complex findings into clear, actionable insights for technical and non‑technical audiences.

### Communication, Training & Enablement
I create dashboards, reports, presentations, and user guides that help teams understand and use their data effectively. I also deliver training and workshops to support adoption of analytical tools and best practices.
