# Welcome

## Kevin Mackay, PhD — Data, Spatial & Research Professional

I help public-sector organizations make sense of complex health, spatial, and administrative data by supporting the full lifecycle of analytical and research projects—from problem definition and data quality assessment to analysis, communication, and future‑proof workflow design.

## What I Do
- **Health & Spatial Data Analysis** — GIS, spatial modelling, administrative data, health indicators  
- **Research Design & Evidence Synthesis** — mixed methods, qualitative/quantitative integration, policy-oriented analysis  
- **Data Quality & Governance** — validation, documentation, assumptions, reproducibility  
- **Project Coordination & Collaboration** — cross-functional work, planning, workflows, stakeholder engagement  
- **Communication & Digital Enablement** — training, documentation, dashboards, user-focused outputs
