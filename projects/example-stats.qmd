## Overview

*Placeholder: Describe one statistics or data project — goal, data, methods, and outcome.*

This example shows where a single project write-up lives. Replace with your own narrative and, if you like, embedded code or figures.

## Methods

- **Data:** Placeholder source (e.g., survey, administrative data).
- **Tools:** R, tidyverse, relevant packages (e.g., `broom`, `infer`).
- **Output:** Summary tables, plots, or a short report.

## Code snippet (placeholder)

Below is a minimal R chunk to show how code will render. Use your real analysis when you add content.

```{r}
#| label: fig-placeholder
#| fig-cap: "Placeholder: replace with your own plot"
library(tidyverse)
tibble(x = 1:20, y = cumsum(rnorm(20))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Step", y = "Cumulative value")
```
