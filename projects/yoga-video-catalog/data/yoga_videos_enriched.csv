Of course, we could not begin a new year together without a cozy day devoted to the core. 🔥 Our final session in this series is a supportive, yogic approach to strengthening and awakening the midline with care, steadiness, and breath. In yoga, the center is connected to Manipura, the solar plexus, and Agni, our inner fire. I like to think of this center as a place for confidence, vitality, digestion, will, clarity, and forward momentum. 

This practice can help support posture, improve stability, build functional strength, and cultivate a deeper sense of inner support and self-trust.
A chance to feel strong, centered, and supported as you move forward into the new year.

Thank you for sharing your practice with me. Please let me know how this session goes for you in the comments!

All my love,
Adriene

As the final recorded class in the Return series, this session prepares us to gather live together next week for our closing community practice. (for those practicing in Jan 2026!)

We begin with a gentle body scan meditation, then move through nourishing spinal movement, soft stretching, and steady breath to explore what it feels like to truly receive the messages the body offers. This session can help release tension along the spine, support mobility, calm the nervous system, and encourage clearer internal communication between body and mind.

This is an opportunity to listen in a way that helps you respond with more balance, both on and off the mat.

☁️ Option to use a blanket or bolster for a supported rest, offering space to listen even more deeply. Bring one if you have it! Absolutely no worries if not. (you don’t need it)

A chance to soften, to attune, and to let your practice meet you where you are.

You have listened to that inner wisdom that tugs at us when the heart, body and mind need tending to. Cortisol is the body’s primary stress hormone, and while it is useful in some ways (such as helping you to wake up in the morning), it can also stay elevated when stress becomes too much on the body. When cortisol is high, you might find yourself experiencing anxiety, racing thoughts, fatigue, burnout, or even trouble sleeping. Yoga reminds us that there are tools to cultivate balance in these moments that feel off kilter. 

This practice is an opportunity to pause for a moment and regulate high cortisol through breath, gentle movement, and reconnecting with a sense of safety in the body. I am proud of you for showing up as you are and taking this time for yourself. Thank you for sharing your practice with me. 

Let me know how it goes for you in the comment section below!

A little can go a long way for someone.

Yoga With Adriene,1G5q66RExDU,Yoga Release | 25-Minute Yoga Practice,25:52:00,878k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G5q66RExDU,"What I love about at-home yoga is the chance to tend to both your physical body and the emotional body. Through the lens of yoga, the emotional body is seen as an important, yet impermanent, layer of our being. Yoga offers us the tools to process and work with our emotions, rather than suppressing or denying them. Just as ocean waves come and go. When tended to with breath, movement, and awareness, it becomes a doorway to deeper self-understanding rather than an obstacle.

In today’s practice, you are given the opportunity to dance with all that comes up for you. What would happen if you held yourself, like a dear friend? What if you allowed yourself to sit with what is, without judgment? 

I am reminded of an affirmation my Mom would say to me growing up: 

allow, release, let go. 

Perhaps we can hold this in our hearts as we share this practice together? 

Let me know how it goes for you in the comments below.

Yoga Sutra 1.2: Yoga Chitta Vritti Nirodhah. Yoga is stilling the fluctuations of the mind. 

Oftentimes our demand for instant gratification leaves us feeling restless, drained, and dissatisfied. Instead, yoga teaches us to release the need for control and our attachment to outcomes. This practice is about surrendering to the present moment. 

By showing up consistently, the path reveals its divine unfolding. Each step is unveiled with patience, devotion to practice, as well as a commitment to self-love. Before you know it, you will begin to see the transformations that took place along the way.

Yoga With Adriene,Ylw_htybRk8,Balloon Breath,10:42,193k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylw_htybRk8,"Today, we are learning a pranayama technique called Balloon Breath! Float into calm with this gentle and effective breathing exercise designed to help you ground, relax, and connect with your body. In this 10-minute session, I’ll guide you through the Balloon Breath technique– a simple practice that uses the power of visualization and diaphragmatic breathing to release tension and invite a sense of relaxation. (Reduce stress and anxiety, improve focus, and strengthen the diaphragm!)

I started teaching Balloon Breath as a young yoga instructor and love how accessible it is for all ages. Perfect for beginners, kids, or anyone looking to reset and find their center, this practice can be done anytime, anywhere. Whether you’re starting your day, winding down, or simply in need of a mindful pause, this video offers a breath of fresh air for your mind and body. 

I think of balloon breath as a good friend. In the comment section below, let me know how it goes for you or if you already use this pranayama!

This soft practice asks, “What connections do you want to strengthen?” 
“Can you allow the experience and wisdom you experienced to stay with you?” 

Perhaps in your experience with Prana you have learned to trust your inner wisdom and your body a bit more. As our journey comes to an official loving close, there is opportunity to find a fresh commitment to your practice and to show up for this necessary and valuable time with - you. Again, making sure that the ripple you are sending you into the world is a conscious one!

This session is a 10 minute bija or seed practice. A little quiet nugget to mindfully wrap up our experience here together, and one you can come back to again and again - whenever you need some solace and subtle body connection.

With a rooted awareness from foot to crown, our journey continues as we cultivate happy feet and happy joints with footwork and a mobility flow. This session reminds us of the infinite possibilities that arise when we take time for ourselves and true mind body practice. It also reminds us of the power of letting go. 

This sweet practice is 23 minutes long and builds strength and resilience with an awareness of directional flows of energy in the body. This type of work can reveal when you tend to rush or be stuck in a certain need for speed, shall we say. Slow down your breath, slow down your body. There is no need to blast your nervous system for results you can see and feel. 

Mantra: I am connected to all things with love and kindness.

Yoga With Adriene,gZ1DtlOJNMI,Prana - Day 2,22:32,963k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ1DtlOJNMI,"This is a mental health wellness practice. Full stop. So, while we utilize familiar asana, allow yourself to focus on sensation more than what you think the poses should look like. This might be particularly challenging not to the beginner but to an experienced yogi who perhaps has been practicing asana in the Western world for many years. Remember, the focus on this series is on the prana body. The energetic aspects that help make up who we are. Have you ever met someone that just had “good energy” or have you ever been around someone who had “bad energy” maybe? I am not here to call one thing good or bad but simply to point out that we often respond to energy because it can affect how we feel. From the yoga perspective we are all all connected through this life force, and so tending to our own energy through practice does inevitably have a ripple effect. 

This mindful practice is 23 minutes long and packed with beneficial moves for the spine, a strong, stable center, healthy digestion, and yummy support for the hamstrings and lower back. 

I hope you enjoy your time on the mat. Thank you for showing up! 

Love, 
Adriene

Yoga With Adriene,9OMd9HxpwZM,Yoga for Digestion - Bija Practice,16:02,431k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OMd9HxpwZM,"Join me as we work with asana to stimulate the digestive organs in conjunction with a subtle body perspective. Through the holistic approach of yoga, this flow is designed to help you digest anything you might be processing both physically and energetically. Whether you are needing help to digest a heavy meal or you are looking for a healthy way to process your emotions, this practice is for you.

In this yoga session, you are encouraged to explore the transformative power of bīja mantras– the word bīja in Sanskrit means ""seed,"" symbolizing the potent, foundational energy from which spiritual growth or transformation can arise. Together we will utilize the ancient practice of bīja to support our digestive health!

Through mindful movements, breathwork, and the repetition of bīja mantras, we’ll ignite the inner fire (agni) that fuels your physical and emotional digestion. The vibrations created by chanting this sound help stimulate the digestive system, promote balance in the gut, and release stagnant energy that may be holding you back.

No experience with chanting or yoga is needed. This practice is simple, grounding, and accessible to all. Whether you’re looking to soothe digestive discomfort or cultivate a sense of empowerment, this session will leave you feeling clear, energized, and deeply connected.

Take a deep breath, settle in, and let’s begin!

In restorative yoga, we embrace the power of slowness and find nourishment by exploring the depths and hidden corners of each asana. Together, we will melt into the postures with each exhale, finding both harmonious intensity and tranquil ease. Notice what happens when you show appreciation for your breath, using the expansiveness of pranayama to create space. This is your moment to turn inward, to cherish sacred stillness. Let gratitude wash over you as you indulge in this gentle yet potent practice. Take all the time you need.

Note that we will be reveling in these poses for an ample amount of time, thus props are highly encouraged.  If props aren’t available, there will be modifications offered throughout this practice.***

Here are some props to bring along if you have them:

1-2 blankets

a bolster (or pillow)

1-2 blocks

A yoga strap (or a hand towel)

Overthinking - many of us have been here. There are many reasons one may end up in a pattern of overthinking. It can be hard to function when this occurs, and it can be a result of many things going on in our life, as well as living in an overstimulated world. 

This practice is here for you when you are experiencing racing thoughts, mental worry, or decision fatigue. For those days when you need to clear the mental clutter and return to the power of now. It’s not just what we do on the mat but how present we are with what we are feeling- noticing and acknowledging the thoughts that arise and letting them fall away with every intentional breath. Let’s embody stillness together as we move through a grounding flow to soothe an overactive mind. 

Please share this one with a friend. Let me know how it goes for you in the comments. 

Much love!

New Moons happen every month, when the moon comes between the Earth and Sun. New Moons are the first phase of the lunar cycle and they are a perfect time to reset! At a time when the shadow side of the moon faces us, we can honor the sacred within by checking in with ourselves, being intentional, and taking a little time for self care. 

This blend of Hatha yoga, breathwork and meditation is a home practice that you can incorporate into your New Moon self-care ritual or whenever you need a little practice to refresh and rekindle your inner light. 

Show yourself some love, indulge, stretch, and breathe into this cosmic energy! I am here to guide you along the way.

Did you know that calves are also known as the ""second heart"" of the body? The muscles of the calf are POWERFUL in aiding healthy body function! That is because they aid in the flow of blood, in an effort against gravity, from the lower body back to the heart. 

Add this practice to your repertoire to improve circulation, enhance mobility, prevent muscle cramps and risk of injury, or if you participate in activities involving a lot of lower body exercise (i.e. running, hiking, soccer, etc.)!

Let me know how it goes for you in the comment section below!

More and more I find myself feeling drawn to the intentional, smoother, subtle body connections that can be found in slower more mindful flows. These are yoga flow practices that truly synchronize your specific body with your individual breath. So in a way, this session isn’t just for beginners, though perfect for newbies! It really is a solid flow practice that will tend to all parts of your body, while allowing ample opportunity to create more balance in the autonomic nervous system.

A short and sweet session to help you take a break and restore. 

*Bring a blanket, towel, or bolster to the mat, if you have available. 

This low-to-the-ground session is a gentle yoga siesta, or a beautiful way to ease in or out of a busy day.

Gently open the shoulders, the chest, and the hips, breathe deeply, rest and renew.

Simplicity is key here but grab a blanket or a towel if you have one. Pillow for the head is welcome. (But this video will work its magic without props too.) 

Perfect for a slow morning, a long afternoon, or in preparation for bedtime. 


Before you jump to scrolling, use this quick restore to stay connected to what feels good.


Ahhhhhh.

Yoga With Adriene,Tp0J0k-aLoI,Center - Day 30 - Return,24:00:00,852k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp0J0k-aLoI,"Here we are, at the end of the journey. For our final CENTER session - I invite you to practice alongside me, and thousands of others in the same moment in a new way. What does that mean? It means, you won’t follow my verbal instruction today, nor should you feel the need to match my moves. *You are the leader today. I am your friend practicing at my own pace alongside. 

This session is different - and yet, in my mind, the perfect way to seal our journey.

Use the vocabulary you have to show up, to shift, to root, to flow and find a big hug. 

Use this session to listen, to rinse, unwind, stretch, be kind. Enjoy the opportunity to connect to your heart, your corazón. 

Find your gaze, cultivate play, explore and restore! 

And with pleasure, find freedom, melt, move and align with what matters most..

The goal of this session is not for our practice to match - but for us to celebrate our connectedness through our individuality and truth.

Set the intention to return to center.
That is what this journey is all about. 

I find that this is the day to remember…

In every end is a new beginning. 

And it has never been more true. This series was an unfolding, a revealing, and an opportunity to commit to daily self-exploration. I hope you have discovered, uncovered, and leaned in deeply to your precious self. I hope your body is alive, your breath - a song, and your heart at peace.

Thank you so much for showing up and sharing this unique and incredible experience of our time with me.

I love hearing from you in the comments, thank you for sharing below!

My advice to you is this, “don’t decide where it ends.” Whatever that means to you, take it to the mat!

**I want to give you the heads up that tomorrow we will be meeting as usual, but you can expect something new. 

You can expect a fresh opportunity to let your practice be a true culmination that is emblematic of what I feel yoga is all about - and why it is the most wonderful tool for a meaningful life of centered living. 

In other words, expect tomorrow’s final practice to be different!

Yoga With Adriene,OOAEgEPX2xQ,Center - Day 21 - Strength,17:41,1m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOAEgEPX2xQ,"Today is about celebrating the physical, mental, and emotional conditioning you have cultivated and experienced thus far.

By now, you may have noticed the ways in which some of the poses are starting to feel different. There are days where your body is tired. Those days will exist, and it is on those days we ask the mind to focus and be strong. On other days you will notice poses that were once unstable and shall we say humbling - are now sturdier, engaged with a greater sense of ease. The body feels stronger.

The strength may also come from having the courage to know when to rest. This is when our emotional state takes priority and is considered.

It is important to remember that strength comes from showing up, not from any one singular approach but from a commitment to cultivating a regular or daily practice of centering.

I have learned firsthand that training your gaze to serve your nervous system so that you feel that the world is working for you instead of against you - is one of the amazing benefits of regular yoga practice. 

What are you choosing to give your focus to?

Remember, where attention goes, energy flows.

While this practice targets the shoulders, chest, neck and upper back body - continue to see the body as one moving part. 

Research has proven that daily movement can be powerful medicine for anxiety and depression. We have the science to back up the myriad of benefits of mindful breath work, especially when practiced with consistency. 

And, I have said it before but I will share again that strength training with less pain and more joy has provided me with a relationship with my body that I never ever thought possible.

Remember, this is a come as you are situation.

You may make some new discoveries today and in the coming week. 

Pay attention to your self-talk.

I believe it is at this point in the 30-day journey where it is valuable to shine a little light on how powerful our relationship with trust is. And perhaps maybe take a little stock in a safe space to do so. 

Are you able to relax your shoulders, your drive to accomplish, your habit of self-judgment today - and trust the process more?

Today we will play with some fun breathwork, and for the rest of the journey, you will see practices that average 20 min in length - with shorter practices in the coming days to support you in keeping up this good work, a new habit perhaps that will serve you for the rest of your days.

No, you don’t have to have the energy to do it. That is precisely the most beautiful thing about true yoga. The practice will show you how to shift your energy. Trust me, all you have to do is show up and listen. 
This is the way I like to guide all of my yoga offerings. Both for myself and for others. This is the practice of listening and responding your way back to center.

Consider this practice a check-in with the energetic body. 

Only 18 minutes, you got this. Thank you for letting me be your guide.

Yoga is poetry. And what many perceive as “core work” is in reality a deep layer of the centering journey. One that really highlights the questions:

Where am I moving from?

Where do my gestures come from?

Yoga With Adriene,XHegE9h0ZvA,Center - Day 2 - Listen,25:44:00,2.7m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHegE9h0ZvA,"In this practice we embrace a key element to the centering practice. How to listen is such an important part of this journey both on and off the mat. When you wake up each day, when you arrive on the mat, what are you lending your ear to? 

When we tune in to what brings us life on the yoga mat, we start to notice this spill into other areas of our life. 

It becomes not just about what is capturing our attention, and what (or who) is the loudest. But rather it becomes about what serves you and what feels right for your mind and body.

Your lymphatic system has many functions! They include absorbing digestive tract fats and removing cellular waste, as well as protecting your body from invaders that can cause you to get sick!

Along with mindful manual self massage, regular yoga can be a wonderful tool to help assist the lymphatic system which relies on movement for healthy function.

Yoga With Adriene,6uVSkvWO7As,20-Minute Yoga for Abs  |  Feel Good Flow,21:33,3.6m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uVSkvWO7As,"I have heard your requests. This is a 20 minute Feel Good Yoga Flow to check in with your breath, move your body, regulate your nervous system, and strengthen your core. 

Some practices tone and strengthen your body (your big, mirror muscles) but leave your nervous system a wreck. This session is intended to do the opposite, allowing you to center mentally and emotionally while receiving that full body flow you crave. 

Connect to the subtle body, work from a place of integrity, and celebrate your body throughout the process.

Yoga With Adriene,QUPAFGv72PM,Move - Day 30 - Choose,29:10:00,1.2m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUPAFGv72PM,"In our day thirty tradition, I am taking off the mic and inviting you to practice alongside me, and thousands of others in the same moment. What does that mean? It means, you won’t follow my verbal instruction today, nor should you feel the need to match my moves. 

You are the leader today. I am your friend practicing at my own pace alongside. 

This session is different - and yet,  in my mind, the perfect way to seal our journey.

Use the vocabulary you have to create stability and softness. Listen to your breath for cues on when and how to uplift, snuggle, savor, and explore. Cultivate love and courage with curiosity and focus.

The goal of this session is not for our practice to match - but for us to celebrate our connectedness through our individuality and truth. 


This is the last session of our journey, choose how you want to feel. 

Rest when you like, breathe like you love yourself, and trust me, trust yourself, trust the process, trust it all. In every end is a new beginning.
Allow yourself to be moved.
Trust me. You have everything you need. 

Thank you so much for showing up and sharing this journey with me.

My loving advice for you today is to think about your yoga practice as training for how you want to move through your life. I hope you have felt a sense of belonging on this journey. It is the foundation for the offering, and where I build from. Trust, this experience is meant to be.

If you are ever in a tight spot, at a crossroads, or unsure how or where to move next…
Find your breath. 

HEAR IT. 
Trust it.
Trust your awareness.
Your gut.

Heads up, we have a purposeful surprise awaiting tomorrow for Day 30! Today’s session is a perfect setup. Do you trust me?

Yoga works. I have built this practice to equip you with the tools to feel empowered in the many moons of your life. Daily practice isn’t always about maximizing. It is about meeting yourself where you are. Ask, how am I feeling?*** And then ask… How do I want to feel?***  The way you respond to this question with breath and through movement is what this journey is all about.

Two more days and then we will engage in our final MOVE session together, which will signify something special.

Heads up, tomorrow will be our last day of guided sessions as you know them thus far - we have a purposeful surprise awaiting us on Day 30!

Stay open. 
Show up.

If you are already wondering what will happen after the 30 days is complete, don’t worry, I have us covered.

This session utilizes movement and breath techniques to highlight the powerful ways in which we can use the practice of mindful awareness to lovingly and safely tend to what triggers.

I hope you take it as a great reminder that this is a training designed to improve your quality of life. I find softness in yoga is a discipline. It at times feels almost like a lost art form in popular western asana. Today’s practice invites us to have fun, to notice how you feel, and soften to the present moment on the journey to find balance in opposition. 

If you want to get stronger and feel more secure, implement softness.

Light a candle. Pour a glass of water. Close the blinds. Or open them. 

We have made it to day 20. Whether you did it in 20 days or more, there are ten more practices left in this series. And the last ten days are my absolute favorite.

Today we are embracing and celebrating the intention behind showing up and the intention behind your movement, and how powerful that can be. 

A little goes a long way, don’t forget.

Follow the sound of your breath and nurture your brain and body. The next ten days are really about embracing the ritual of the at-home practice.

What makes it a ritual?

Snuggle up. 
Give yourself grace.
Stay open to being moved.
Trust the power of your consistent devotion to showing up for yourself. 

Day 17 ends with some breathwork and contemplation you won’t want to miss. Stay with it, till the end. You must. You must. The journey is the reward.

This is your time, your body, your breath, your story, your brain, your reality that you’re creating for yourself, so make it about you. 

When we create safe, healthy spaces for us to make it about ourselves and listen and check-in, then it has an incredible ripple effect on how we show up for others.

Your practice is about you. And it’s OKAY to make it about you.

Just like all of these practices, we are showing up to improve function in both the brain and body. Use the breath to accentuate your experience as we explore half-moon, standing splits, crow pose and more.

***Yoga is a discipline*** 

Focus is a practice. 

And the focused gaze has rich meaning both on and off the mat.

This session is not about crocodile breaths, creative squats, or eagle pose. 
It is about our willingness to learn how to focus our attention with awareness.

This is vital in the home practice, and extremely beneficial not only for how you move throughout life but to set yourself up with a daily practice you can sustain and grow. 

While we have been working on core stability and hip stability, in order to balance the flexibility you are no doubt already exploring/seeking - today’s session is all about neurological control and strength.

We are talking range of motion, joint health, decreasing injury, and increasing tissue health. We are talking integrity.

How well can you actively move yourself?

Wear something extra comfy if you can. Grab a blanket, maybe a pillow too. 

*If you don’t have any of these things handy and you are just squeezing this in, no worries. The important thing is that you show up for practice.

This can then lead to us feeling more confident and more capable of loving ourselves. 

And that of course can have a beautiful ripple effect, a movement beyond ourselves. 

So as we begin to add more vocabulary and depth through visualization and imagination remember, 

How you move matters.

While we will get the blood flowing and heart pumping today - this session is an opportunity to check in with the mental and spiritual parts of yourself. 

This is, in fact, what the ancient practice of yoga is all about. 

Today’s session is a loving training for the brain and body. Perfect for those who have flow experience, but even better for those entering with a beginner's mind. Use your breath and the vocabulary we have created thus far to fall into your flow state today.

It will require your attention and focus, so start with your breath. 

I don’t have many rules in practice, but one I do have is this:

The breath always comes first.

Your brain and nervous system will be continuously regenerating as you experience the 30 days - gaining new knowledge and feedback. 

Build a new foundation with your breath and you will receive more benefits from your journey.

Today’s practice is an acknowledgment that the breath is always there for you. If you are ever unsure of how to begin again, may this practice remind you to start with a new breath.

On this final day of the journey I take my mic off and practice with you, alongside you. This is a tradition I have incorporated since my very first 30 Day Yoga offering, and to me this journey would not be complete without this ending and this invitation. Don’t panic. You have the vocabulary, you have the connection. You have it all. 

Allow one breath to lead you to the next. One present moment to the next. As your guide, as your friend, I will still be here with you. You may always use me as a guide. Trust your vocabulary, trust the integrity that you have been bringing into this practice.

If all you do is lie down on your mat and breathe for the duration of this practice, I think that is great. 

But I think that you will find that you have the curiosity, the energy, the interest, and the trust in yourself to Find What Feels Good and to create and embody your practice.

May you open your heart and mind to having a deeper connection with your breath on and off the mat.

May your heart and mind be open to believing in yourself and the power we receive when we take a breath and begin again. 

I always get emotional on Day 30 because I think this is such a truly special and remarkable, meaningful exchange. Thank you for saying yes. 

I hope that this journey has served you and continues to serve you in the form of regular practice, holding you and celebrating you, for many more days to come. 

May you be inspired well beyond today to keep returning to your practice, returning to your breath, returning to your self.

I would love to hear from you today, drop me a note in the comment section below.

Believe you are on your path. The invitation is both simple and profound today. It invites us to recognize how time with conscious breath, contemplation, and mindful movement can lead us toward genuinely believing in oneself. Trusting oneself. Trusting the quality of that relationship as you continue to change, transform, and grow. 

We continue to ride the wave of the breath and remember, the mat is a mirror.
Trust your vocabulary. Trust the integrity that you have been bringing into this practice.

Tomorrow is our final day of the 30 Day Journey. The invitation will look a little different, but the goal is to begin by finding what feels familiar… and then be open to where your breath leads you. 

If you can, set aside an hour for Day 30. If that just made you panic, use the tool of your breath to stay open. We bookend this journey with two long sessions. 

I am giving you a gentle heads up that tomorrow will be different! I will be asking you to trust, to believe, and to take the tools we have learned together and marry them with your experience to begin a practice that is truly yours.

Have faith. 

Have faith in yourself. 

I promise you, I have your back.

Some days it’s as though all is seemingly in the flow, and some days it feels heavier, darker. Our practice offers us the opportunity to pay attention, to notice, and even prepare for the spills and the dark moments.

And while we cannot prevent them, nor should we, the dark moments are a part of life and of our existence. We can use these tools and our experiences on the mat to prepare for the tough moments.

And for the moments where healing occurs, or the moments where healing is possible. 

The practice offers us the tools and awareness to help prepare us for the important moments on our journey. 

You have been working hard. I think it is so beautiful and heroic for you to keep showing up in this way, it’s not easy. It is remarkable, and you are building a habit for utmost wellbeing. 

Bring your blanket to class today, if you can. If you want, bring two.
If there is time, take a moment to set up your practice spot with intention. Maybe today you light a little candle, or adjust the blinds.

Often we are energizing things that are not serving us, whether it is through our thoughts, actions, our daily rituals, our habits. 

This practice gives us the tools to notice that where our attention goes… energy flows.

Today we begin with the breath of fire, to stir the pot energetically, and give you the juice you need for this rejuvenating flow. 

What are you ready to bring new energy to?

This session highlights how yoga practice can be a practice of devotion, a dedication to one’s self, and the way in which that is connected to everything. We continue to dedicate time, attention, and energy to finding conscious breath. 

Today’s contemplation is split into two parts with the invitation to really devote this time and exploration to what feels authentic and good for you. And, to understand or stay open to the fact that this is not just for you, it is for everyone who may cross your path too. 

1. What does it mean to dedicate yourself and really give yourself over to a practice, a project?

2. This is an opportunity to cultivate generosity and to be of service. Each time we come to practice, join our hands in prayer, come to our appropriate edge. May we also use the energy we cultivate in our practice to send some energy to someone else?

Can we build love and awareness within, dedicate to that, so that we can share it freely with others?

We don’t stay in our bubble of awareness - we cultivate it to expand it and share our gifts.

If it is difficult, remember this is a practice, it is a training, but we can choose to dedicate ourselves to showing up. Dedicate to the process. Dedicate your attention to your breathing.. and the rest will unfold.

Today’s session invites you into contemplation on what it means to renew. As with many of these practices this theme is meant to be thought provoking and applicable in more ways than one.

Chewing on the philosophy of yoga and dropping in to wherever you are today, we continue to put the puzzle together, remembering all the wonderful vocabulary we have learned together thus far.

The practice of renewal is powerful! It is one of my superpowers for sure. Anytime I find myself in the struggle zone, I slowly pull this practice out of my tool belt, and find my way back to center with a reverence for both the struggle - and my ability to make my way out to move… forward.

Before I established my renewal practice through regular yoga I found myself on a hamster wheel. Maybe you can relate? 

If you need it, take today to restore and renew your commitment to this journey. 

This 22 min sesh will fly by. I will meet you there.

Today’s central theme is not just designed to guide breath control, but to also roll out the red carpet for you to expand your mind and your relationship to the mantra Find What Feels Good. What is it like to focus not just on the WHAT, but even more on the HOW? 

The same way that you have to bring the breath, you have to bring the awareness of how you are doing something. You get to design how many layers, you get to pay attention to the details… or not. You get to decide the flavor. 

How you move matters. The art of quality control. Both on and off the mat.

The focus on breathwork continues today, with an introduction of gentle breath retention. Building on our breath ratios, we will learn to implement a small conscious pause between our inhalation and exhalation… and the exhalation and the inhalation. Think of it as a circular thing. 

Breath retention has loads of benefits and is safe to practice slowly with mindfulness. If you have serious cardiac and hypertension problems, you can skip it. Stick to the counts and enjoy the benefits of ratios as we all continue to learn to re-pattern so that we may breathe more optimally.

Your ocean breath, which we have learned and used in previous sessions, is a perfect match for Kumbhaka. Combine the two and explore!

However, strength practice is not just about sculpting and toning, though hear me loud and clear, this ongoing practice will sculpt and tone, it just will, it’s true. But perhaps more importantly so, this type of breath-led work, which is what yoga is, can guide you to gather and build strength in more ways than you could ever imagine.

Please do not miss this session as I include some of my favorite lessons for growing your practice both in asana and yogic philosophy. If you want to advance, do this work. Step into your power. Learn how to move from center. 

We ease in today, so if you are tired or feeling unmotivated, I got you. Practice slowing down at the beginning of this session, then join me as we mindfully layer to POWER postures.

We will connect to subtle body gestures to make deeper discoveries that may (they will) support you both on and off the mat. 

If you are already wondering what you will do when the 30 Days is over, don’t worry! I have a red carpet of options ready for you. I will share them soon.

I will introduce some foundational elements for the next wave of this journey, as well as offer practice of a new technique called breath ratio. Breath ratios are breath patterns set to counts. They are a wonderful tool for expanding your awareness and ability to control your breath.

They are also full of transformative potential and wonderful to pull out of your tool kit when you are feeling mentally, physically, or emotionally stressed or lost.  

They can be short, or long, but they do require a bit of focus and yes you guessed it…. discipline.

This whole session is low to the ground with a nice therapeutic breath for the arms, shoulders, and wrists. As it is seated, do sit up on your blanket if you have one. If you need to do some or all this practice in a chair or on the edge of a couch, do it.

We focus on creating sensation and space in the body, learning to breathe and move with efficiency, mindfulness, and even sometimes joy - so that when we step off the mat we can continue that practice. 

This way we may proceed to learn and live with more ease. 
This way we have proper energy in the tank to serve others more fully. 

We are approaching the halfway mark!

If you would like, take some time to write about how you are feeling (physically, mentally, and emotionally) after experiencing the first 14 days of this journey!

This is your time, this is your practice. Take up space, darling. You are so worthy of it all.

It is that you are taking the time to check in each day to connect to yourself and to your source. 

To me, this is a beautiful, complete, and highly productive act of self-love and self-care. 

Each day is going to look and feel a little different. Keep this in mind as we continue to progress on this journey. 

Building on yesterday, we keep our discipline but explore how we may “drop the doing” and Find What Feels Good.

While we want to continue to be mindful and disciplined about our alignment and action - when we begin to allow ourselves to make intuitive decisions based on how we feel - our experience on the mat can really feel like one that serves and supports the real you.

The quality of that conversation will change from moment to moment, day to day, week to week, year to year. The awareness of this ongoing conversation might change your life. It did mine. 

Gently dropping your ties to the exterior and taking time for yourself is not selfish. 

When you arrive on the mat remember you are there to experience your body, and your breath. You are there to snuggle up to your truth, what feels like home, what feels honest.

Take the time to drop in. 

YOU ARE DOING GREAT!

Alternate Nostril Breathing, also called Nadhi Shodana, is an incredible tool for activating the parasympathetic nervous system which can restore balance - particularly if you are consciously, or subconsciously, living more in fight or flight mode - which is common in such uncertain times. 

We will introduce the powerful play of opposites in yoga asana as well, considering the ways in which we may join steadiness, or STHIRA, with ease, or SUKHA.

I will guide postures today that are there not to discourage you, but to help you play with the concept of how to create a dance for both steadiness and ease, and one that is individual for you. 

I invite you to use this material to check in, learn, and grow. 

Remember, it’s not about being able to stand on one foot. 

Learn the process of centering yourself, and remember, it’s a process.

If you fall, I will catch you.

You got this.

Don’t miss it. Get on the mat today.

Core-centric practices are great for toning muscles that support strong and optimal function (read - less back pain) and, let me just get this out of the way, you will be working all of your abs into a fine fiery burn. 

But this type of work can also be really healing and centering. 

Core work, similar to balancing postures, encourages you to take stock and embody the present moment as a way of creating sustainable strength and stamina. 

While it can sometimes feel discouraging, it is most necessary that you take on the task of beginning where you are today. This is how we evolve, it’s how we learn to know ourselves better, and it is how we get stronger.

Notice what it feels like to be alive today. 

Burn away that which no longer serves.

Rather than just doing the poses, or doing yoga, trust that the practice really is an art of listening. Listening and responding.

Our vocabulary grows today as we continue on our explorative journey, kicking it off with diaphragmatic breathing. 

Most people do not breathe as well as they can, and I do mean MOST. 

We continue with intentional and intuitive movement to improve our posture today, why? 

So you may breathe better, my dear. 

Re-training the posture is one of the best ways to ensure you are breathing deeply and efficiently.  

When we are breathing deeply and efficiently we invite a WHOLE WELL of benefits our way.

On days where your mind is in the future, or maybe your heart is in the past, this breath can help you ground in the present.

The mantra today is…

Yoga With Adriene,GaL3YF1vY2k,Day 2 - Arrive | BREATH - A 30 Day Yoga Journey,37:35:00,3.4m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaL3YF1vY2k,"With each breath we have the opportunity to begin again, to arrive in the present moment. In this foundational phase of this journey, I invite you to see each new practice as a new arrival.

Accept and celebrate that each day will be different. Some days you will have more energy than others. Some days it will seem as though the universe is supporting you to show up, eagerly, and fully. Some days your brain will* make it very hard for you to arrive, and it may seem like the exterior is winning over your interior goals. 

Make your #1 goal to show up on the mat. 

Self-care is learning the practice of meeting yourself each day, learning about who you really are, and continuing to arrive to devote yourself to the process of self-discovery, not perfectionism. 

With each breath, a new arrival. 

It’s a powerful tool, and one we are going to cultivate and celebrate together.

We begin by taking things nice and slow. You will soon feel more fire, you may move fast, but this series asks you to be disciplined about bringing awareness to the deeper layers of your practice - with breath. 

What makes this 30 Day series unique is that these practices are designed to work together 1-30, not just as one-offs, though that is time well spent too. 

This series is a process with intention. Today’s practice is all about listening, respectfully setting the tone, building foundation with slow and with purposeful movement. 

Thank you for joining me on this journey and for sharing this connection with so many people around the world.

Today’s video is a bit of an orientation, a warm welcome, and an official kick-off. We will begin with a few easy group breaths to enjoy, and recognize that if all you do is arrive here to breathe, you are winning, golden, exactly where you are meant to be. 

You can consider this a practice day for your upcoming practices if you like. 

**IMPORTANT** If you are not signed up for the daily email that corresponds with each practice video, sign up for free and receive your free BREATH calendar here: https://www.yogawithadriene.com/breath

Work with what you have, but in this video, I make some suggestions on some optional things you might like to bring to class each day, along with an invitation to help guide you as you embark on this unique journey. 

Check-in with your willingness to be present, and remember for this to take off - you have to show up.

If this cross-legged position is not doable for you, you can use blankets, blocks, or pillows to sit up on. You can also come into a chair, or on the edge of your couch when we take this shape. That is a great way to modify and possibly a better spot for you to tune in, work with the breath technique, and warm up before we get moving into other shapes each day. 

Finally, set an intention. Be brave and ask WHY? Why are you here? What do you think pulled you here? And if you don’t know, that is okay, we will likely uncover that together. (How exciting!)

It offers us the tools to stay present with ourselves and to be present with one another in the NOW. Now can be uncertain, uncomfortable, and at times, not fun. We long for time with friends, and activities that feel supportive, we miss togetherness, and we fear for the future. 

Take time to fill your cup, practice feeling your own presence, and share sacred space with one another!

Allow. Release. Enjoy this practice.

Yoga With Adriene,hoGJXCg5yb0,Fundamentals of Ease  |  35-Minute Home Yoga,34:03:00,1.9m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoGJXCg5yb0,"Join me for this 35-minute practice with a focus on the movement and philosophy of ease. Sometimes, this is easier said than done. It can be “easier” to do what you are told rather than find what feels good and be present in your body. The fundamentals of ease is a practice that can shift the way you arrive on your mat, and the way in which your time there serves you.

This holistic session will be nice for beginners but also beneficial for anyone at any stage of their yoga practice as it focuses on the philosophy of one of my favorite yoga sutras which teaches us ultimately how to balance effort with ease.

Start by asking: Where can you soften?

And, breathe, baby, breathe.

For this practice, it is a Day 30 tradition for me to take the microphone off. Can you trust me? Can you trust yourself?

You are going to use the vocabulary that we have learned together thus far to choreograph your home practice and to create your experience today. You have the tools. You always have had everything you need to uncover and to reveal what matters most.

This is such a beautiful day because, for me, it really does embody the spirit of Yoga With Adriene and this exchange that you are participating in.

It is this essence, or spirit, that says, “Hey, I am taking care of myself in my little corner of the world, but also…I am right here with you. I got you.”

Try to keep an open mind, please move slowly, and as always, prioritize your breath. Use me as a reference or a guide. You have everything you need. Trust it. Trust it all.

It has been my truest honor and pleasure to accompany you on this journey. Thank you for allowing me to guide you and thank you for welcoming me into your HOME.

Please remember that in every end - is a beautiful new beginning.

I honor you today.

Today, I invite you to find freedom within the form. Don’t decide where it ends. Embody it. Listen. Pay attention. Respond. Intuit. 

This is a powerful practice that starts with a good dose of spinal flexion and ends with creative core. Look, we have come a long way so I intuited that a little Wu-Tang boat pose was most necessary, for me. Don’t forget… it’s okay to have FUN!

Use your breath to bring yourself back home, darling. We continue to play with our vocabulary today before our final session, Day 30.

We are almost there, though I must gently warn you… tomorrow’s practice will be different. But the same. (Cool, Adriene.)

It is all a part of the journey, which is most certainly the reward.

The process is the candy. 
See?

Honor the time you’ve taken to listen and hone your intuition. Seek to move in a way that feels truly in alignment with who you are.

Finally, let’s try to get in the habit of taking only what we need and not more than what we need.

What do you say?

In a lot of ways, the journey HOME is about simplifying. Peeling back those parts, those habits, those layers that take away instead of giving back. It’s about reuniting with the type of vibration that gives life and connection to your relationship with yourself and to the big picture.

When we take time to notice, we can start to pay better attention to the things that nourish.

But don’t forget, “simplifying” and “nourishing” doesn’t connote easy.

We can build sustainable practices and rituals that serve. This can have a direct effect on how we carry ourselves, energetically, posturally, and in the way, you hold space for yourself and for others.

We will also take time to nourish parts of the body that could be a little bit sore from the past few practices.

When we nourish ourselves, we can better serve others.

This journey HOME offers a worthwhile opportunity to learn about your body, integrate the breath, and ultimately explore how to move better. I invite you to consider what it means to move well. We approach today’s practice with a willingness to explore what it means to integrate.

Try to think of the body as one complete moving part, versus a bunch of different units. Then, notice if that changes the quality of your breath and the quality of your movement.

Only 3 more practices after this!

If you are already wondering what you might like to do next, I have your back! We have free Yoga calendars that are curated each month and dropped on our calendar page here:  www.yogawithadriene.com/calendar

This session asks us to look at our patterns and to take stock of our habitual side and its power. The tools of yoga invite you to get in the habit of keeping the things that work for you and gaining the awareness to notice the things that aren’t working for you.

It’s about listening and responding. 

Keep what works, let go of what doesn’t serve.

In this practice, we continue to work from the center and the midline, still working to nurture a strong foundation in order to build strength from within.

Today’s 20-minute session should fly by but will require you to dial inwards. For how else will you balance on one leg, my dear?

The invitation today is one in which you can focus or re-focus back on your WHY. What led you to go on this journey in the first place? Remember, the goal is not to aspire to transform into something you have not yet become, but rather to return home to embody everything that you already are, fully. 

In this session, we will focus on neck and shoulder relief, spinal flexion, and use what we’ve learned so far to maintain balance between the left and right sides of the body. Use the flow to build heat and enjoy the process of learning to find your balance. 

Pro-tip: work with your breath and lead from your center. 
Where attention goes, energy flows.

This is a slow flow class to soften out the hard edges, inviting you to continue to pay attention to the sensations in the physical and emotional body. I love regular daily, at-home yoga practice because I really get this sense that every time I show up, the practice is catching me on any given day. 

Wherever I land, with whatever I am bringing, the mat has my back. What if that were true? Our exploration in yoga practice can stir up some powerful mind and bodywork. 

Continue to slow down your breath, move mindfully, and stay open. 

This practice (and this whole project) is designed to support you and have your back. 

Stir it up, little darling. Notice what it feels like to be alive today. 

Be kind to yourself. Be gentle. Create space. If you are this way on your yoga mat, you are more likely to be this way off the mat.

I like to think that this notion of coming home really does make sense, because we are not trying to achieve balance, but rather return to it. The path to balance isn’t always in the “doing.” It can be about the undoing. Both require listening. 

In addition to your daily alignment work, this flow lights up the energy we’ve been cultivating this entire journey. It includes two sets of plank push-ups and some balancing work. But don’t let that intimidate you. Instead, acknowledge what it took you to get here. 

Look how far we have come. You should feel proud.  

There is an option to follow this practice with an extra pranayama video if you have time. This breath will help to balance the left and the right side of the brain and body: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VwufJrUhic

Remember to take a breath of gratitude. 
This is valuable time you are giving yourself. It’s a gift. You better believe it. 

Believe me when I say make it your own. Believe in your own intuition. 

Embrace the slower-paced action to find that inner intrinsic work that is most valuable and necessary for when you are thrown off balance. 

Work from the inside out based on sensation. This is about working with your body. Not on it. 

What would it feel like to wake up each day and have a practice where you believed in yourself?

If you are feeling a little tired today, heads up, I got you. In fact, you will stay on the ground in a comfortable seat pose stretching it out for about the first 10 minutes. 

Look. It’s all about connection. 

Take the time to seek it, play with it, unlock it, use it to bring yourself back to savor the moment, over and over again.

Stay open to the small (or large) ways in which these practices can show up off the mat.

I cannot describe the true power of knowing when and how to hit the reset button. 
I practice this on the mat and then I find this power with me off the mat, 
Showing up when I need it most. 

A connected RESET isn’t always comfortable. 

But trust it. Try to find something new today!

The breath is your number one tool for RESET.

Make use of it. You are doing great!

In the philosophy of Yoga, we are not actually ever working towards the goal of becoming someone or something that we are not already. We are already that thing. That which we desire, we already possess. We are not trying to step out and change, conform, or embody someone else’s idea or concept of who we should be. 

This is a return. 

Expect, a juicy hip practice that engages the whole body. 

As we stir the pot today, anchor your thoughts by choosing something specific that you want to return to.

Feel it out. Loving reminder: You have everything you need here. 

So move mindfully and take your time. If you are not in rhythm with my guidance, that is okay. 

Move at your own pace. Work where you are today. (There are so many layers to play with!)

Darling, allow yourself to… dig in.

It’s 18 minutes that should fly by, so whatever you are coming to the mat with, try to stay focused and take yesterday’s inquisitiveness with you. 

You might find it easier to find your breath when you are flowing in and out of shapes. 
See if you can find that same depth of breath today as we ground in new asana vocabulary. 

Take whatever you are working with today and make a home for it. 
Allow it to teach you, serve you, reflect back to you. 

This is a practice for the mind and body. Ground. So we can grow. 

I got your back!

Consider the idea that our practice is not one of “doing,” or one of imminent mastery, but rather one of self-study. This is key for the journey HOME. 

What feels good? What doesn’t? What feels honest?
Can we begin to close the gap between how we feel and how we want to feel?
This time is about examining your self. It’s not about doing it right. 

When we approach the practice through the lens of self-study, we find that we have everything we need to both gracefully and fiercely move toward what serves… and to move away from what doesn’t.

Honor your inner voice. Celebrate the learning process.

Yoga With Adriene,b5fxInaetEQ,Home - Day 8 - Heal  |  30 Days of Yoga,26:29:00,2.1m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fxInaetEQ,"It is easy to spot and own our physical wounds. But our emotional wounds seldom get the attention they need for real healing. Innately we know, even if you don’t understand, that it’s all connected. Yet, we often feel we lack the time, space, and tools to sincerely tend to what ails. At-home yoga provides us an opportunity to heal ourselves. To seek and work to find a way to check-in, recover, restore, and begin again - each time we show up. 

Today’s low to the ground moving meditation reminds you that your only task is to listen and respond. 

And to be honest about it. 

I hope you enjoy this session and find a moment to relax whatever might be gripping, to let go of that which is no longer serving you, and to Find What Feels Good. 

Bring a blanket and a pillow, if you have them at hand.

This hands-free session offers an opportunity to re-balance the body after your first six practices, providing relief in the shoulders and wrists while initiating grounding energy to help you get in the right mindset for week two.

This is not just the bendy, stretchy stretch practice you might anticipate. No way, we said we were going all the way HOME. 

Stretch your mind’s eye, your imagination, and your awareness a little further beyond the physical body today. 

(Don’t fret, your body will get a nice opportunity to stretch it out too.)

This practice includes a lot of philosophy to ignite more than just a fire in the core muscles of the body. 
In the midst of a targeted core practice, who knew you could learn and love so hard? Prioritize that. 

This core strength session is all about valuing presence over outcome. 
Be present with what is. This is what the yoga practice lovingly asks of us. 

This session may not be easy. It really is not designed to be. 
I talk about why at the end of the practice.

You are working, but not any harder than you need to. See if you can let your breath do some of the heavy lifting today. Experiment.

Learn to soften around hard edges. Practice softening in hard times. 

Can a rise of a breath guide you into a pose?

With regular practice, I start to experience a feeling in which I am living in a body that is working for me, rather than against. Pro-tip: activate your breath - and let it do the work for you.

Devote to this practice and you might just activate your damn truth and abundance. Or, at least you will continue to lay the foundation for a fulfilling, sustainable at-home practice.

What, if anything, is lying dormant or inactive?
Are there things you are capable of but you have not embodied or seen to fruition yet?
As the great teachers before us remind: the mat is a mirror. 
Today’s yoga offers a way to wake up and uncover. 
But please, dear friend, take this with you…
Awakening is a process. 

Awaken a fire, a kindness, your magnetic presence, stir stagnant energy. 
Your inner world awaits! Be patient with short muscles and stiff joints. 
This practice includes one of my favorite tools for moving energy and getting out of a funk.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. 

Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. 

Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. 

It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. 

When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

This journey is about reuniting with your self through regular practice. Through the process of getting to know who you really are, you will find that you need not prioritize the where, or the what, as much. 

You just have to be brave enough to look inside and recognize who it is you see.

The opportunity is to be who you are and recognize where you are, today.  

The choice is to do it honestly and with kindness. 

In our first practice, we apply this to asana and open up to the postures serving as opportunities to make discoveries. 

We ease in with a powerful practice of observation and recognition. 

This is your longest class of the series, one in which sets the tone.

In this session, we bring focus to the 5th Chakra or the Throat Chakra, an area the body that asks us to find our voice and snuggle up closer to our truth.

Practice this session anytime or anywhere to stretch, breathe, re-center, and connect back to what matters most.

Bring attention to your neck, shoulders, heart. Use gentle throat openers and utilization of the breath to help move energy and find balance. Let go of what no longer serves to make space for a fresh wave.

When working with the throat chakra, you are invited to focus on your originality, expressing your authentic voice and using that voice to speak your truth.

Allow the story to unfold.

Find What Feels Good.

Optional:
Wear something blue!
Bring a blanket to your mat.

This gentle class invites a full body awareness and focuses on a deep opening of the muscles around the hips, lower back, and legs.

Our hamstrings can get tight when we sit too much or when we overtrain the quadriceps. When this happens, the hamstrings begin to pull down on the sit bones, making the pelvis and hips tight and flattening the natural curvature in the low back.

Create stability while welcoming in a relaxing release as we work to invite equilibrium to both mind and body. Build your practice toward Sleeping Vishnu Pose! Breathe deep, move mindfully, and enjoy!

Yoga With Adriene,SrN9pBY0KZs,Reunite With Your Center  |  19-Minute Yoga for Core,18:46,1m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrN9pBY0KZs,"Join me for this 19-minute yoga core practice! You know me. Although there is a focus on the core in this video, this practice is not your typical “get ripped” or “washboard abs” exercise sesh. It’s about consciously returning to and building both muscle and connection at your core center. We do this so that we can deepen and grow our practice, but also to tap into an inner strength that will carry us throughout the day, improving posture and relieving fatigue.

This session will invite you to focus on activating the parts of the body that not only tone but also support stability. Breathe and center yourself at the core to welcome mental and emotional stability as well.

Get ready to lovingly generate some core heat and reunite with your center.

Let’s go!

Let me know how you are feeling in the comment section down below!

Namaste.

With so many joints in the hands, this is a body part that is susceptible to injury and arthritis if not properly taken care of and where many yogi’s often experience wrist fatigue or pain.

Optimal alignment and weight distribution in the hands and wrists are very important and in this video, Adriene guides the proper hand placement in poses like downward facing dog.

Stretch out the fingers, warm up the wrists, and set up for success with a strong foundation.

Our relationship to our belly needs some love, it needs some real work. It’s going to take us being brave enough, kind enough, bold enough to slip back into the role of the observer to notice our thoughts and words and how they make us feel. 

Everyone is talking about Yoga Booty, but why are we not talking about Yoga Belly??

In this practice, take some time to connect to your center by breathing into and sending loving awareness to this very important area of the body.

Ring out the internal organs with some gentle twisting and elongate the front body.

Lower stress levels and reduce blood pressure with deep, diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing.

This practice serves as an invitation to check in and see how your thoughts about your body, specifically the belly, make you feel.
Does your relationship to your belly need a little (or a lot) of love?

This is our final yoga session of this program. Per tradition, today will require you to have faith, keep an open mind, and listen to your body. 

For your day 30 session, I will take off the mic and practice alongside you, encouraging you to utilize all of the tools you have learned on the journey thus far. I will not verbally instruct this session but instead, invite you to lead your way. 

Find freedom within the form, use me anytime you need me. I'm here for you! Check-in for ideas on what to do next, or simply enjoy the music as you move on your own.

Move slow, be mindful, and remember, the breath comes first. 

You cannot go wrong with this practice as long as you trust. 

You have everything you need. And more.

It has been a total honor to be your yoga guide and even more of an honor to be your friend and fellow human in this process and on this journey. 

Remember, it’s not the end. 

It is most definitely the beginning. 

Namaste, 
Adriene

This video is the official kick off for your 30 Day Yoga Journey! In this short orientation video I share my top three tips for success with the program. Use today to set an intention and prepare for the journey ahead. You have already said yes to dedicating this time to tone muscle, improve mobility, clear your mind and focus inward. 

If you are healing from an injury or brand new to yoga - you can do this program. You will just need to modify, as will every single one of us at some point on the journey. 

This is a 30 Day Journey about uncovering your authentic self. It’s not about re-creating, emulating or copying someone else. Trust me, trust your self. You just get your butt to the mat and together we will find the rest. I promise.

The practices in this program are absolutely suitable for pregnant women with the use of some modifications. Avoid twists and core work and always ask your doctor for advice based on where you are in your pregnancy. I advise that when in doubt, you supplement your twists and core work with slow and loving breathing.

In this Foundations Of Yoga video, Adriene guides a practice of Shoulder Stand for beginners. Though not for everybody, Shoulder Stand is known as the mother of all asanas! There are benefits to learning the prep work for this pose allowing you to work at your own pace, safely, and with controlled breathing. Inversions can seem intimidating, but done correctly, at your own pace, and with neck integration and awareness, it’s possible to enjoy the revitalizing benefits they have to offer at any stage. Benefits of this practice include, increase in immunity, healthy blood flow, healthy digestion, as well as an opportunity to soothe the nervous system and any irritation, with regular practice.

For this video, you will need two blankets or towels. Remember to focus on the process and the journey rather than the endpoint as we explore the postures of bridge, plough, fish, and shoulder stand.

Be mindful and remember, the breath always comes first. Hop into something comfy and let’s get inverted!

Please, speak to your doctor if you think inversions may not be right for you.

When we are insecure we limit possibilities for growth and turn into folks who are just trying to survive. 

I fell in love with yoga because it guides me to recognize my power.

When I choose to recognize my power -  my brain, my body, and my spirit taste and feel like an oneness. 

I don’t feel insecure or afraid, I feel whole. 

Without a doubt, it is my at-home yoga practice that has shaped me and provided me with the time and space to explore not just my body but the connection to my spirit. 

That recognition will turn your fears away and allow you to flourish in the garden of peace and happiness.

Believe in yourself, your uniqueness, your worthiness.

I believe we each have this special unique quality. 

The tools of yoga and the process we allow on the mat help us uncover, reveal, and align with what feels like our true purpose. 

Authenticity.

It is my hope that through this practice we become closer to ourselves and therefore closer to finding out what our meaningful contribution to humanity is. 

All that on the mat?

Yes.

Today’s practice invites you to slow it down and be still. 

Listen to what is going on inside. 

Time on the mat is time well spent because it’s time that you get to practice listening. 

If you are here for the hip dips, great. 

But today we refocus on why we are truly here. 

Day 14 is a self-study & mindful mental health practice that is also a delicious and restorative day for the body, particularly your neck, back, and shoulders

Not just mindless ab workouts. 

Meet your appropriate edge today. Do your best and remember this is about spending quality time exploring your connection to your body and your breath. The strength comes from that. 

Light the fire!

Our modern cultures have trained our minds to think of the body in a very distorted way. The language we use to shape the way we think about the body needs to be tended to. So it is with great irony and fun humor that I include ABS into Day 6 routine. It's okay to want that strong pack. (Pass me a cold one?) But pay attention! Pay attention to what actually feels good and move from there. We are no doubt getting stronger. Ripped. But it's only a by-product of the deep relationship we are cultivating with ourselves. Hot prana bodies unite!

Surprise yourself.

Namaste.

PS: I changed the title of this puppy to Attention instead of Awareness so that you could consider what it actually is that you are prioritizing when you take time for yourself. What are you paying attention to first? Your flat tummy? Or the smiling of your amazing, unique, brilliant, and fierce soul?

This yoga practice is built to help you stay strong and present in the challenging moments of life. Use this yoga practice to meet your edge, turn it around and find support from within. You are your own best cheerleader and when we practice mindfulness on the yoga mat it creates a presence we can take off our mat and into our every day. We begin to move with more ease and trust. 

Fear is a part of life, but if we let it take control it can often leave us feeling like we are  constantly struggling, second guessing, dropping the ball, letting ourselves down and indecisive. It can also cultivate an imbalance in the energy of body that can quickly form into - anxiety. Yoga rules, anxiety drools. Let go of that which does not serve you and step into your power with this fierce NO FEAR practice. 

Great for those wanting to trim and tone too. Use your breath and return to this practice again and again to see how they mind and body work together anew - each day!

With Yoga Camp, we ask - what is the point of a rigorous workout if you still are waking up in the morning and looking in the mirror and not loving what you see? What is the point of 50 chaturangas if you look in the mirror and don't know who it is you see? Who cares if you have a rocking body if your mental wellness is a hot mess! Can we live a rich and beautiful life if we don't love ourselves?

I am so incredibly inspired by your willingness to ask the big questions, do the work and tend to not just your physical fitness but your mental health as well. I believe this is a way to true self-compassion. Enjoy your practice.

Learn SITALI, the cooling breath, or as I like to call it - TACO BREATH! I believe a breath practice has so much power. It can transform your patterns in the mind and body and can empower. Great after a run, a workout, an argument or when you need something simple to connect to the big picture - whatever that means to you. Balance your POWER YOGA class, your cardio, your crossfit with SITALI! Use pranayama to tend to yourself. Practice this one when you need to calm down, cool off,  relax or decompress. This is a great one for when you feel discomfort from anxiety. This breath can  help you focus, relieve you from that pissed off feeling and is also great when you are physically heated in the body. Offering a nice controlled breath to cool down. This breath is great when you or a loved one is agitated. Great for the kiddos! Also awesome before big meetings, tests or if you are finding it hard to go to sleep. It may seem weird at first - but let's get the whole world doing taco breath as an aide to stress, anxiety, etc! Grow this practice with a focus on that long smooth exhale, activate your body's relaxation response... and feel the difference. Don't worry if you cannot roll your tongue - I got you.

Transformation is not about becoming something you are not. It is about coming back to your true self. That is the beauty of Yoga and integrating the principles of yoga into your work out. All yoga is yoga for weight loss -  in a way - because it's all about awareness and loving yourself. 

This yoga practice gets FIERY with a focus on opening in the hips, stretching the hamstrings, a core connect and some neck and shoulder love. This was a big request from the kula (community). This is a nice full sequence to connect your mind to your soul and to work that body! Be mindful, move with your breath, and enjoy!

GET the full EMPOWER course: https://ywa.co/EMPOWER

It's sunny, it's sweaty and it is perfect for those trapped in by snow. Also just a challenging work out for those who don't like the gym or anyone needing that extra push to move it and groove it. HEART aims to get the heart rate up and invites you to sweat and get the blood pumping. A practice that invites you to open your mind and heart to new things. This ""Power Yoga"" sequence provides a full-body experience to connect you to your spirit, burn calories, and work it out. Connect you to your breath and get the blood pumping! This is my version of ""Cardio Yoga"" without all the frantic fitness frenzy!

Though this practice is swift, I encourage you to move at your own pace and listen to your body. Allow the vinyasa to move with ease and take your time growing this practice. This vinyasa fusion focuses on toning and building strength in the lower back body. Connect your feet to the earth as you build strength in the legs, the glutes, and connect to your core to support lower back health.  

I invite you to arrive on the mat for this practice with an open mind and HEART.

Here are some Foundational Videos that might assist you as you practice HEART 1:

This balancing posture can be challenging at first but offers a long lasting relationship of tending to yourself. Balance, twist, stretch, strengthen and stimulate! Boost focus, concentration and the lymphatic system! The eagle fixes his eye on one point with superior vision and focus. This yoga asana connects us back to the third eye chakra – which stimulates clear vision. We practice eagle pose, or Garudasana, to aide to check in with our concentration and fix our gaze upon one point. This pose requires that you keep tending to it. 
As you balance and spin multiple plates (on one leg!) and twist and bend (metaphors galore!) you hold on to your drishti or your gaze and begin to settle in. That third eye chakra of sight and intuition begins to open. The more you tend to the pose – the more likely you are to calm the mind and the clearer your vision becomes. Go deeper! Namaste.

We learn another pranayama or breath technique and of course, have a little fun with a full body practice.

This 20 min yoga sequence has it all! It invites you to go deeper. Re-connect to home, ease, and mother earth. Yeah, I said it. Simple meditation pose is there for you. This yoga sequence also invites you to get low and be human. Explore all lines of movement with the support of the earth. We will stretch, open, and remove stress that has manifested in the body. We will tend to the feet and trek into the unknown! We will connect to our core - and keep returning back to the breath - reconnecting to YOU.

Modify as needed and find what really feels good. This practice will give you a good workout, stretch, strengthen, and soothe. But beyond that, this breath focused playtime is the perfect sequence to practice letting go. Let go to create space for empowerment and newfound strength. Let the practice be a mirror. Don't be hard on yourself. Be yourself. Be kind. Find freedom within the form and strength in letting go. Practice forgiveness as a way to keep moving forward.

Yogi style. This is a shorter practice to tone the abdominals in a mindful way that feels fun and supportive! Also, almost everyone wants more core strength and tone abdominals. You asked for it!
Use this Day 6 practice to check in with the core. Mindful core training will support your entire practice and whole-body health. While tone abs are something we all fancy (me too) core strength training is so much more than washboard abs or a flat tummy. By building core strength you are supporting the back and all of the muscles that surround your dear spinal cord. By working those muscles we are taking some of our weight off the spine and engaging the entire body. We are more likely to do active, engaging things when the body is strong & engaged. Great for runners, dancers, movers and shakers! Great for grounding the spirit.

Forget What You Know About Yoga! It is so easy to slip into automatic pilot. For today's sequence, come into a beginner's mind. (Bonus if you are a beginner and totally new to yoga!) When we come to this idea of beginner's mind - we open up to all possibilities.

Use this Day 3 practice to check in with balance and connect to your core center. Let go of expectations and stay receptive as you work to build strength and unlock more space. Again, open up to making new discoveries! If you are regular yogi this practice will be a great opportunity to change it up. If you are new to the practice, ROCK ON, you have that beautiful beginner's mind already. Seek opportunities to learn - especially in the difficulties. Everyone, close your eyes when you can, move mindfully, and trust yourself. Breathe. Breathe slowly. This revitalizing and strengthening sequence is great for balance, core & hip check-in, and supports good posture! Explore where you are TODAY.

There are some more restorative practices on the way, I promise! Plus shorter sequences begin to weave in and out! Stick with it!!

Yoga With Adriene,TXU591OYOHA,30 Days of Yoga - Start Here,5:07,6.1m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXU591OYOHA,"Welcome! Thank you for joining me for the 30 Days Of Yoga experience! Watch this video before you begin! 

It includes helpful ideas and tips to support you on your journey! Today we begin with this video! Tomorrow - DAY 1 of YOGA. 

 As we transition into the New Year I already feel great about the idea of practicing for 30 days straight. I feel excited about challenging myself, connecting to myself, and learning something new. I am grateful that my body is able to move, that my breath is capable of deepening and I love that I will be doing it with so many others, around the globe.
 
The hardest part each day will likely be getting on the mat. Make time. Stay focused and choose to make the experience your own. This 30 Day practice is intended to support you in finding what feels good in the New Year. So, though it may be challenging to make time for your practice – just do it – knowing that it is okay to adapt, change, modify, rebel and do your own thang at any time.

But get on the mat. 

Take conscious breaths and stretch each day as a way of connecting to your intentions, your big picture, and ultimately, complete wellness.
 
Why not? Let's reach for the stars!

Yoga With Adriene,jbtLH-3DfLc,Breath of Fire - Pranayama Series,13:40,817k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbtLH-3DfLc,"Learn a new yoga breath technique with Adriene! In this pranayama practice we tackle the Breath Of Fire or Kapalabhati. This powerful breath is rhythmic and consists of short strong exhales and passive inhales. It works the diaphragm and when practiced regularly can benefit the entire muscular body, remove scary toxins and sharpen your focus! 

Breath Of Fire is a cleansing breath that can reboot the system and is especially yummy during winter months when the respiratory system/bronchial passages could perhaps use some extra TLC. 

Go deeper with Kapalabhati Pranayama!

Adriene shares tips on creating a strong and healthy foundation in Table Top Position - which will assist you in other poses and invite more integrity into your asana. Have fun!

REBOOT provides the tools for powerful transformation while keeping a sense of humor. It invites lasting changes, new relationships to the body and supports you in creating and maintaining a home practice. 

REBOOT is the gift that keeps on giving! I could not be more grateful for this experience and am excited to see the community grow!

Bakasana is a Hatha Yoga arm balance that challenges the mind-body connection in the most fun way and strengthens the core. Also known as the Crane pose, this posture strengthens the arms, the wrist, the back body, and the abdominal organs. 

This asana also teaches us and reminds us of the importance of integration in our postures. We work to create a full-body experience to fly in our posture. Keep your gaze forward and rock in and out of it. Stay positive! Crow is a wonderful posture to return to again and again for inspiration and a reminder to focus on the practice. Breathe deep, take your time, and enjoy the journey! The journey is the reward!

Everyone can benefit from this practice and it can be repeated daily to improve wrist pain and assist with Carpal Tunnel! With the amount of hours we spend at the computer or at desk it is important to spend some time counter acting and tending to the wrists and all of the muscles that tie the room together. You can practice this at your desk or before yoga practice. You can repeat this sequence or each move 3 times, or do one move a day. I often hear people complain about wrist pain both on and off the mat. There is hope for us yet- lets commit to a practice of checking in with the wrists! Move with your breath and find what feels good - remember a little mindful TLC goes a long way. 
Enjoy!

It has been a major struggle and oh so emotional so I wanted to set intentions to let go of the difficulties and make my surgery day great. I also thought I should get this voice on record. Note- I had to bump up the volume just so you could hear me!

All ended up going well. I am currently on vocal rest with many sweet friends checking in on me daily. Its been rough but man, I am a lucky lucky gal. The silence has definitely given light to the inner journey and my quest for center. I highly recommend you take one day each month to just be silent. There is so much there. So much.

Yoga With Adriene,Om03hOv_jcU,Samasthiti - Foundations of Yoga,2:26,152k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om03hOv_jcU,"Our first ""silent"" episode! This new series is from the heart. I lost my voice this summer and have been adjusting my life and my work to vocal rest for healing. Because Chris and I met on a movie set and we both have an affinity for the silent movie era we decided to get creative and have some fun. Thus- the silent yoga series was born!
This video focuses on Samasthiti or Four Parts Equal Standing. An important and valuable tool for all standing postures where we ground down through the four corners of the feet but also draw energy up from the earth. Also valuable for all other postures- taking the essence of this balance, engagement and ease into all asana & movement.  Find your yogi toes in time and feel that dual action of grounding and lifting! It takes practice but can be an empowering tool for asana and daily life. This may seem ""easy"" but there is more than meets the eye here. Connect inward and work from the ground up and the inside out creating a full body experience! Practicing this pose can improve your work out and the essence of your practice! *Check out our Mountain Pose video in the Foundations of Yoga Series for more on this posture!!! You can also connect this to the Sun Salutation video - beginning and ending with this posture like a baller. 
A simple pose with A LOT to offer. 

Less talk more walk! Reside in the silence, the breath. Find what feels good. 

Practice and share your feedback with us. How would you describe the essence of Samasthiti and its benefits? Have you ever gone without speaking? Do you believe in the power of silence? Share with us down below!!!

This is a great practice for those suffering from acid reflux as it does not have any inversions or ab stimulators. It is also great for those who are in healing, wanting to relieve PMS, or just tired from a long day. A quick and valuable sequence suitable for all! 

In my experience with GERD or acid reflux in particular - I find that focusing on my breath has been most helpful. Also, do not let the stomach go over the esophagus during this time and go easy on any core stimulators. For more free yoga tips and lifestyle ramblings visit www.yogawithadriene.com

Journey to Mobility,N7bw5VMPvZ4,10 min Full Body PARTNER Stretches | Valentine's Day Special ❤️,11:38,198k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7bw5VMPvZ4,"Learn how to do some fun partner stretches at home! We'll focus on our upper body for the first half of the video then move onto some lower body stretches. 

See the first partner stretching video I posted here: https://youtu.be/6dJoxXAr5z0

✨ Helpful Tips for Partner Stretches:
- Be gentle, always listen to your partner
- Communicate clearly, tell your partner *how* you would like to feel each of the stretches (do you want the stretch to be more gentle? to go a little bit deeper? hold a stretch longer etc.)
- Focus on using your inhales to lengthen (sit up tall) and exhales to relax into the stretches
- Have fun and learn more about each other!

Journey to Mobility,270PLc0efm4,"18 min Stretches for Bloating, Gas and Indigestion | Get Rid of Bloated Belly",19:16,12k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=270PLc0efm4,"Struggle with Bloating issues? This stretching routine will really help you relieve discomfort from Bloating, Gas, Indigestion, Constipation and IBS. We'll focus on gentle breathing exercises, spinal twists and hip opening movements that will help you feel great again!

I've struggled with bloating issues for years due to food intolerances and period bloating. My tummy would expand 2-3 inches. It even got to the point where I would wake up equally as bloated. Doing these stretching exercises really helped me relieve discomfort and lift up my mood! I usually do them in the morning and in the evening as needed. I hope that these stretches will help you with bloating, gas and indigestion!

Happy Stretching :)

🎉🎉🎉 THANK YOU FOR 5000 SUPPORTERS!!! ❤️😭 So happy that I'm able to help each one of you stretch more and hopefully learn to love movement as much as I do! Maybe I'll do a fun video at 10K? :)

Journey to Mobility,juGV_XcNNsE,30 min FRONT SPLIT MOBILITY (Follow Along),29:49:00,12k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juGV_XcNNsE,"Learn how to do the Front Splits with this front split mobility routine! For best results, try to incorporate deep stretches for the splits a few times a week. Listen to your body and rest when needed, learning the splits is a process. 

Looking for a Splits routine for Beginners?
Beginner Front Splits (PART 1): https://youtu.be/y1hA4GLdZZ0

MY FRONT SPLIT JOURNEY (As an Inflexible person!)
I learned how to touch my toes and get my front splits in 5 MONTHS as an ADULT. I never took dance classes, gymnastics or martial arts as a kid. 

When I started my Splits Journey, I had extremely poor flexibility and muscle stiffness from over 5 years of weight training. Growing up, I was never able to sit comfortably on the ground with my legs crossed without leaning back to use my hands as support. To be honest, learning the splits was never my goal until I was an adult - I have learned so much about my own body and learned that I COULD DO what I never thought was possible... (which led me to start a Beginner Flexibility Blog and THIS YouTube channel to help more people GET to this feeling) Read more about my Front Splits Journey here:

https://journeytomobility.com/front-splits-journey​

I still regularly practice the front split at least a few times each week to help maintain flexibility, improve energy, loosen tight/sore muscles, and overall helps with sports performance & movement!

WHY LEARN THE SPLITS?
Learning the Splits will help you achieve many Flexibility skills - including toe touching, forward fold, jumps, kicks, turns, flips, pole tricks… which require flexibility and good range of motion in the hips, hamstrings, quads, calves, & glute (lower body flexibility).

If you're working on your flexibility, feel free to reach out and send me your process pictures over on IG (@journeytomobility)! Also let me know what you're working on in the comments below and suggestions for future videos 🤗~

Today we'll be doing a Full Body Active Flexibility flow. By practicing active flexibility exercises, we learn to use our muscles and joints to hold a stretch rather than using an external force such as our hands or gravity. It's helpful to think of ""active"" as engaging your muscles to help you reach a little further into the movement. Whereas passive flexibility relies on body weight, a strap or another external force while muscles are relaxed.

Active stretching is more effective than passive stretches for improving flexibility. Active flexibility trains us to mobilize our joints and strengthening the connection between our mind to our muscles. I tend to include a few active stretches here and there. After this routine, maybe you'll be able to identify them in my other videos!

----------------------------

🌟 HELPFUL TIPS FOR STARTING A CHALLENGE:

• Have a clear mindset: ""Maybe I was never flexible BUT, it's something I CAN work on"" 
• Set your Intention to stretch: ""I will [Stretch] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].""
• Create a Place for stretching (I used to have a fluffy rug in front of a mirror with my stick figure stretch routine where I would stretch every night)
• Print out your Calendar and Keep it where you can see it everyday :) Ex. living room, your desk
• Focus on How your body feels while doing the stretches
(How are you breathing? Which stretches feel the best / are most challenging for you? Are you aware of which muscles you are stretching? How do you feel after stretching? Are any of the stretches getting easier over time? Are you able to correct your form? etc)
• CELEBRATE the small wins 🥳 ** ALL OF THEM!

**Flexibility is really training your body for the long haul - although you might not see results in months, everything ADDS up. It took me about 5-7 months to really see myself do amazing amazing things. I believe that you can get there too!

---------------------------

🙋 FAQS

If any of the stretches are TOO HARD...
That's totally okay :)! There are always ways to modify the stretches by using a pillow, yoga strap or even a towel. Focus on getting the correct FORM, above all else. Don't force yourself, more practice will get you there!

If any of the videos are too easy....
Feel free to swap out a video with another video that you prefer. For example, If you love the 12 min Hips routine then do that one instead of Beginner Hips! So long as you're stretching - I'm happy hehe

If you're working on specific Flexibility goals...
You many want to swap out 1-2 of the videos with a video rom the Beginner Flexibility Series if you're working on your front splits, side splits, pancake stretch: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhYA9mI0GcOMasA0fwbJd63oJpHaLtIF

If you missed a day...
I would just do the stretching video the next day and cross it off the same! The goal here is really to just stretch and spend the time for ourselves~

--------------------------

Every Journey begins with DECIDING to make that change for yourself. I really hope that completing this Stretching Challenge is a small step towards helping you feel better now & MOVE better in the future. Keep at it!

This is me WISHING YOU THE BEST for this Stretching Challenge ❤️ ~~

These are some of my favourite relaxing self massage techniques that you can do while sitting.

Grab yourself some massage oil or lotion - you'll need this for the massage techniques shown in the video. You can also use olive oil or coconut oil which will also double-up as moisturizer if you'd like! (Why not?). Add essential oils if you'd like a more relaxing massage experience.

I love doing these in the evening or at night time before sleep. Repeat this neck self massage video again for a longer massage session or pair it with another video from the 5 MIN ""CREATE-YOUR-OWN"" Stretch series (https://youtube.com/playlistlist=PLGhYA9mI0GcNZXlK9a7vNB67gYrp5CAYW).

Happy Stretching & Massage :)!

Journey to Mobility,Hvt_GhuSmGc,Middle Split Follow Along FOR BEGINNERS & non Flexible!,20:26,17k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvt_GhuSmGc,"Learn how to get your Splits with this middle split follow along routine - Perfect routine for BEGINNERS and inflexible people looking to get flexible. Full modifications are included. 

This video is part of the  **NEW Beginner Flexibility Series** 🎉. My goal for this series to help those of you who have specific Flexibility GOALS that you are currently working on. 

Do this beginner middle split follow along routine 2-4 times a week for the best results (listen to your body and rest when needed). Flexibility training takes months to years of dedication but I truly believe that ANYONE can become flexible (the way I did!) and I hope that the videos in this series will help you get there too. 

READ ABOUT MY MIDDLE SPLIT JOURNEY HERE (As an Inflexible person!)
https://journeytomobility.com/side-splits-progress/

When I started my Splits Journey, I had extremely poor flexibility and muscle stiffness from over 5 years of weight training. Growing up, I was never able to sit comfortably on the ground with my legs crossed without leaning back to use my hands as support. To be honest, learning the middle splits was never my goal until I was an adult - I have learned so much about my own body and learned that I COULD DO what I never thought was possible... (which led me to start a Beginner Flexibility Blog and THIS YouTube channel to help more people GET to this feeling).

WHY LEARN THE MIDDLE SPLITS?
Learning the Splits will help you achieve many Flexibility skills - including jumps, kicks, turns, flips, pole tricks… which require flexibility and good range of motion in the inner thighs, hips, hamstrings, quads, calves, & glute (lower body flexibility).

If you're working on your flexibility, feel free to reach out and send me your process pictures over on IG (@journeytomobility)! Also let me know what you're working on in the comments below and suggestions for future videos 🤗~

Happy Stretching :)!

Journey to Mobility,eP5dVjUCKoo,Rotator Cuff Exercises & Stretches (FOLLOW ALONG),10:48,5.3k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP5dVjUCKoo,"As requested, here are some Rotator Cuff Exercises and Stretches to help prevent injuries by keeping the rotator cuffs strong and flexible. This is especially important because our shoulders are the most mobile joint in the body which makes it that much easier to injure.

Today, we'll be stretching and strengthening the rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis), as well as the muscles around the shoulder that can cause shoulder pain and rotator cuff pain.

When I used to weight lift at the gym, I would include these rotator cuff exercises between sets using a 5lb dumbbell - regardless of what I was working out that day (chest, shoulders, back, legs). Sometimes I would use a stick or resistance bands. Rotator cuff exercises are great to do before exercise, when you're resting or if you're taking a break during the day if this is an area you're working on!

Rotator cuffs also help you perform better when exercising

Happy Stretching & Strengthening :)!

These hip stretches are easy to add to your daily routine as a quick way to instantly relieve tightness in your hips. Grab yourself a yoga mat or a soft surface - you'll have the option to place a pillow underneath your back for the final pose. Aside from that, we can get right into the hip stretches!

Do these these beginner hip stretches after a workout, or as many times as you need during the day to give movement back into your hips! I like doing these ones as a break from the computer or right after work.

This is another video from the 5 Minute ""Create-Your-Own"" Stretch series. You can repeat this video if you'd like to do these hip stretches again or pair this with another 5 minute video to target different areas like your neck, wrists, lower back, mid back, quads (so many to choose from!) etc. That way you can pick and choose which areas you want to target today~

Our ankles provide stability when we are doing activities like running, walking and jumping. Do these ankle stretches before a workout, after a workout, on recovery days or as many times as you need during the day if you're looking to improve mobility. 

Over time, you should feel like it's easier to move and stretch your ankles - especially while doing the hero pose (sitting on your ankles in a kneeling position)

This is another video from the 5 Minute ""Create-Your-Own"" Stretch series. You can repeat this video if you'd like to do these ankle stretches again or pair this with another 5 min stretch video to target different areas like your neck, wrists, lower back, mid back, quads etc. That way you can pick and choose which areas you want to target.

These stretches are all Beginner-Friendly and I'll try my best to remind you to breathe into the stretches and let you know where you should be feeling each of the movements in your middle and upper back. 

Many of us experience pain between the shoulder blades and these are great mid back pain relief exercises to target this hard-to-reach area. 

Do these stretches anytime during the day or night. This is a feel-good routine with a relaxing ending pose which you may want to have a pillow for. The pillow will just be there to help support your lower back. It is definitely optional - but this will make the stretch that much more relaxing!

As always, let me know in the comments if you enjoyed this routine and if these stretches have helped you in any way! I used to not know how to do upper body stretches hahaha only a few months ago actually.. but now I'm in love with including them in my daily stretching routine!

Happy Stretching :)!

BEGINNER-FRIENDLY, Full modifications are included. 

Second video from the **NEW Beginner Flexibility Series** 🎉. My goal for this series to help those of you who have specific Flexibility GOALS that you are currently working on. 

Do this follow along routine 3-5 times a week for the best results (listen to your body and rest when needed). Flexibility training takes months to years of dedication but I truly believe that ANYONE can become flexible (the way I did!) and I hope that the videos in this series will help you get there too.

MY FRONT SPLIT JOURNEY (As an Inflexible person!)
I learned how to touch my toes and get my front splits in 5 MONTHS as an ADULT. I never took dance classes, gymnastics or martial arts as a kid. 

When I started my Splits Journey, I had extremely poor flexibility and muscle stiffness from over 5 years of weight training. Growing up, I was never able to sit comfortably on the ground with my legs crossed without leaning back to use my hands as support. To be honest, learning the splits was never my goal until I was an adult - I have learned so much about my own body and learned that I COULD DO what I never thought was possible... (which led me to start a Beginner Flexibility Blog and THIS YouTube channel to help more people GET to this feeling) Read more about my Front Splits Journey here:

https://journeytomobility.com/front-splits-journey/

I still regularly practice the front split at least a few times each week to help maintain flexibility, improve energy, loosen tight/sore muscles, and overall helps with sports performance & movement!

WHY LEARN THE SPLITS?
Learning the Splits will help you achieve many Flexibility skills - including toe touching, forward fold, jumps, kicks, turns, flips, pole tricks… which require flexibility and good range of motion in the hips, hamstrings, quads, calves, & glute (lower body flexibility).

If you're working on your flexibility, feel free to reach out and send me your process pictures over on IG (@journeytomobility)! Also let me know what you're working on in the comments below and suggestions for future videos 🤗~

First video of the **NEW Beginner Flexibility Series**. My goal for this series to help those of you who have specific Flexibility GOALS that you are currently working on. 

Do this follow along routine 3-5 times a week for the best results. Flexibility training takes months to years of dedication but I truly believe that ANYONE can become flexible (the way I did!) and I hope that the videos in this series will help you get there too. 

WHAT IS A PANCAKE STRETCH?
A Pancake stretch is an advanced stretch where you sit with your legs in straddle position (legs apart) - feet flexed and knees pointed towards the ceiling. You would then walk your hands forward until your chest touches the ground! 

We'll be doing a modified Pancake stretch in this routine with a pillow underneath our bums. As a beginner, it's okay if you can barely sit straight in a straddle stretch. The pillow will help tilt your pelvis forward and allow you to target muscles in your inner thighs and groin. We'll need to work on the muscles here to successfully do the Pancake stretch in the future :). As long as you feel the stretch in your groin area - we're gooooood.

Right now, your pancake stretch might look like a straddle but just keep reaching forward!

Check out my Pancake Stretch Progression (Before & After pictures) on my Blog:
https://journeytomobility.com/pancake-progression/

This is also a great stretching routine if you're working on your straddle stretch, pike stretch or middle splits (side splits).

Feel free to reach out, send me your process pictures and let me know what you're working on in the comments :D~

Happy Stretching :)!

These stretches are NOT your basic standing quad stretch ;)! All of the movements are beginner-friendly. We'll need a pillow for this stretching routine. The pillow will help support one side of your hips to keep both hips aligned, that way we'll be able to focus on targeting the tight quadricep muscles. Pillows are also just super comfy to sit on!

Do these this quad stretch routine after a home workout, on recovery days or any time during the day when you need a quick stretch break. These targeted routines also help if you know that your quads are a problem area!

This is another video from the 5 Minute ""Create-Your-Own"" Stretch series. You can repeat this video if you'd like to do these quad stretches again or pair this with another 5 minute video to target different areas like your neck, wrists, lower back, mid back etc to target multiple areas at once! 

Happy Stretching :)!

Journey to Mobility,VSoNl_WSCiI,Beginner Hamstring Stretch with Strap | Tight Hamstrings (Follow Along),12:59,24k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSoNl_WSCiI,"10 minute Hamstring stretch routine with a strap, in supine. We'll start off by warming up our hamstring muscles then holding the stretches for 30-45 seconds (longer holds).

I would definitely recommend getting yourself yoga straps in the long-term if you're working on your flexibility, especially if you have super tight hamstrings. Having a yoga strap will help you really target your hamstrings for a more effective stretch. It also helps if you can't reach for your toes. With yoga straps, you will eventually be able to pull your leg to your body! (Best feeling ever)

If you don't have a yoga strap, you can use a long towel, band, belt etc. something you can use to wrap around your foot for these leg stretches. You can even prop your leg on a door frame! (I used to use the frame of my closet before getting a yoga strap, I mean it works... haha). You'll also need a pillow for one of the hamstring stretches to help tilt your pelvis and hips forward.

I really like doing hamstring stretches in the evenings. Your body tends to warm up faster after moving around for most of the day. Remember that if your hamstrings are really tight, these stretches probably won't be that 'easy', but doing these stretches on a Daily basis or a few times a week will really help you see improvements! Hope you enjoy these hamstring stretches!

Happy Stretching :)!

Journey to Mobility,xk7q1w42lcc,5 min Mid Back Stretches | Mid Back Pain (Follow Along),6:46,17k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk7q1w42lcc,"Quick Mid Back stretches for Mid to Upper-back pain. I find the Mid back to be a difficult area to target - it's the feeling of your shoulder blades pulling apart, really creating space in this area. My favourite mid back stretch is the back slump where we hold behind our legs and hang from our legs to create a ""C-shape"" with our spines. This one really gets the spot! (Let me know if you felt it too!!).

Kit Laughlin explains this back slump stretch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzzkrQmLEjk

If you notice that your back is very flat while doing these movements, you may need to practice more ""C-Shape"" spine mobility exercises like the cat and cow and learn how to engage your spine.

All of the videos from the 5 Minute ""Create-Your-Own"" Stretch series are great to do mid day (mid back, mid day... huehue). You can repeat this video if you'd like to do these mid back stretches again or pair this with another 5 minute video to target different areas like your neck, wrists, lower back etc. Many more videos to come! (YAY).

If you are working on your flexibility, try to incorporate more stretches throughout the day - get your body used to MOVING! Also incorporate stretches that target your tightest area.

Happy Stretching :)!

For today's stretching flow, we'll be doing some gentle leg stretches to relax our hips, hamstrings and feet. Then moving onto some upper body stretches for our shoulders, neck and back. Do these full body stretches at home after every workout to cool down and feel relaxed. This is also a great routine to do after a long day at work or when your body is feeling tense or stiff.

Post workout stretches are important for maintaining flexibility and will help your body recover faster. I like doing these stretches in the morning to feel nice and relaxed or at night after an evening workout. Feel free to repeat this video if you have more time to stretch!

Happy Stretching :)!

This an area that we often workout (booty gains) but do not stretch out very often because this area gets tight and it affects other areas like out hips and lower back. It's an important area to stretch out regularly.

All of the stretches in this routine are beginner-friendly. We'll be sitting the either way through. You can do these routine as often as you'd like to relieve lower back pains and release tightness in your glutes. After doing these glute stretches I'm sure you'll want to stretch out this area more! Feels sooo good and very needed.

Happy Stretching :)!

Journey to Mobility,iMXEKL0zMsk,Lower Back Pain Relief Exercises at Home | 5 Minute Stretch,6:55,18k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMXEKL0zMsk,"Here's a Quick 5 minute Lower Back Pain stretch routine that you can Follow Along with! I've gotten many requests for how to stretch lower back for those experiencing lower back pain. We'll also be targeting our hips, glutes and hamstrings. Since tightness in these areas create discomfort in the lower back.

All of the stretches in this routine are beginner-friendly. We'll be on our backs the entire way through - so be sure to have a soft comfortable surface to stretch on! You can do these routine few times a day or as often as you can throughout the week to relieve pain in your lower back.

This is the Third video of the 5 MINUTE ""Create-Your-Own"" Stretch Series where I'll be creating videos that target specific areas of the body like our necks, hips, lower back - you name it!

Basically, if you have 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes to stretch you can Pick and Choose which areas of the body you'd like to stretch and ""CREATE-YOUR-OWN"" stretch routine. For example, you can choose to stretch your wrist and pair that with a neck stretching video, if that's where you're feeling tight today. You can then choose the same or different areas when you're stretching tomorrow. That way you can customize your routine to really target the areas that are tight for YOU - it's different for everyone! 

Happy Stretching :)!

These are beginner-friendly stretches that you can do a few times a day or everyday to really improve your leg flexibility. Basically, it helps you get your feet from 90 degrees to less than 90 degrees which makes it easier to grab your foot while doing leg stretches. 

Stretching out your calves will also help improve hamstring flexibility - if your hamstrings are tight making sure you're also stretching your calf muscles!!! I used to do calf stretches everyday at the gym for 4 minutes while walking on the stair master as a warm up and I saw huge improvements!

These are stretches you can do AT HOME, they are also great for mid-day stretching breaks to help you get moving. Do these calf stretches everyday for ~2-3 weeks and you should see a lot of improvement!

Happy Stretching :)!

This is a Follow Along stretch routine that's great to do if you have tight quadriceps from running, if you are working on your quad flexibility or if your lower body is feeling sore after a leg workout. 

This is a beginner-intermediate stretch routine. The way this routine is structured is that we'll be doing some warm up exercises in downward facing dog to get our quads moving and start to warm up our leg muscles. Then diving into some deeper quad stretches in a lunge position as well as pigeon flow towards the end. Use yoga blocks as support as needed - that's always an option! You will also feel the stretches in your hips and glutes.

Remember to stretch only as far as what's comfortable for you, hold and breathe. It's always important to be gentle with your body when you stretch, not to push it further. Always check your form and breathe slowly. We'll be holding most of the stretches for 15 to 30 seconds to allow your body to relax.

Happy Stretching :)!

Journey to Mobility,gcLc5vnMr-o,HAMSTRING Stretches for Flexibility (FOLLOW ALONG),18:10,30k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcLc5vnMr-o,"Follow along deep Hamstring Stretches for Flexibility. This is a great routine for those of you with very tight hamstring muscles looking to be able to touch your toes or if you're looking to relief tightness in other areas of the body like your hips or lower back pain. For lower body flexibility, it's so important to stretch out each of these areas.

TIPS FOR FLEXIBILITY:
If you're just starting off with flexibility training, make sure to include some of these deeper stretching exercises at least once or twice a week targeting a few areas in your body that are the most tight (you can gradually increase this number as you feel ready for it) to really see progress with your flexibility over time. It's definitely a slow process but in the long run, you'll be able to do all of these stretches easily. If you're only stretching once a month or whenever you're experiencing pain - then you're not really going to get the results you want. The more you do these hamstring stretches the better it will be for your leg flexibility!

Happy Stretching :)!

Do this stretching routine everyday to target back stiffness from prolonged sitting. This is no equipment required, it is a beginner-friendly stretching routine that you can do AT HOME or at your desk (which ever is most convenient for you!). 

A tip to help with flexibility when you are first starting off is to be more aware of your own body. I'll help by reminding you about WHERE you should be feeling each of the stretches in your back and to breathe as you relax into the stretches. Over time, you will be more aware of your body on your own and be able to identify which stretches work best for you. Hope that this follow along stretch routine will help you relieve back pain as you work each day to improve your body!

Happy Stretching :)!

All the stretches in this video are Beginner-Friendly. For the best results - do this stretch routine everyday to improve your hip mobility and slowly increase the range of motion in your hips. 

Our hips and hip flexors feel tight because they physically become shorter when we sit for long periods of time. What we want to do while working on our hip flexibility is to do hip stretches regularly to elongate these muscles and allow them to lengthen. It takes a lot practice and consistency - just continue to do these hip stretches as often as you can (*frequency of stretching is sooo important*) and the stretches will feel easier over time. You'll know when your hips are not tight when you can do a deep lunge without feeling too much of a stretch in your hips!

No equipment is needed for this routine. You can do these stretches in the comfort of your own home and get those hips moving! (You'll even get better at doing those hip circles!! - I promise, they feel less and less weird the more you do them). 

Happy Stretching :)!

This is a follow along stretching routine for beginners. We'll be stretching out the sides of our bodies first and then making our way into some deeper shoulder mobility stretches. You can do these stretches AT HOME or at your desk - where-ever you need a stretch!

If you don't have a yoga mat, you can use a pillow or roll up a blanket to support your back for a few of the stretch positions at the end of the video. Do these shoulder stretches everyday or every other day to improve your overall shoulder flexibility and relieve pain.

Happy Stretching :)!

Start your practice seated as we gently warm up the wrists, shoulders, and spine, setting the foundation for a nourishing practice. Transition into standing postures, building some heat through postures like Warrior Three, Half Moon, and the (hopefully!) playful 'tying the shoelaces' or 'putting a climbing shoe on' balance. My invitation is to embrace those wobbles as we stand on one foot, lifting the opposite knee as high as we can.

As we wind down, return to a seated position for passive stretches. Explore a gentle chest opener and a forward fold, release tension with side bends. Finishing the moving part of the practice with hip 'openers'. 

Conclude this daily flow in a relaxation position, allowing the body to settle, breathing through the nose 🌟✨

In this practice, we start in a seated position to bring awareness to the breath, explore twists, warm up the wrists, and eventually transitioning to a standing positions/movements. 

We explore the quality of fluidity by moving without stopping form one position to the other. As if going through the loop. No destination, just exploring the process and the journey. How does it feel like to move fluidly from one asana to the other? Remember, there is no right or wrong answer. 

There is also some quick core activation in this practice.

Finishing in a seated position, checking in with how you feel in this moment, post-practice.

Thank you for practicing together. 🙏

Yoga with Ieva Luna,rTgfqOjIKUA,10 min Feet & Ankle Mobility | Yoga Routine for Climbers & Athletes,11:35,2.2k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTgfqOjIKUA,"Welcome to this 10-minute routine all about feet and ankle strength and flexibility! 👣🧡

In this class we explore various calf raises, walk on tip toes, heels, and the sides of your feet. Afterwards, transitioning into seated stretches, incorporating circles and movements to enhance ankle and foot mobility and strength. Finishing the practice with a quick foot massage. 

This one's great for climbers (as we wear tight shoes) or anyone who play sports or walk a lot.

Yoga with Ieva Luna,_x2rJEQ_ntc,25 min Full body routine | Approved by physio Jason from Hooper's Beta | Yoga for Climbers,27:56:00,56k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x2rJEQ_ntc,"Join me for a 25-minute follow-along full-body routine designed specifically for climbers, in collaboration with the physical therapist Jason from Hooper's Beta.

In this yoga inspired class for climbers, we will focus on building strength and flexibility in these key areas of the body: knees, hips, spine, and shoulders. We will also activate the core and also playfully challenge ourselves with some balance postures on one foot. 

Throughout the routine, there will be various options to incorporate a weight for added challenge - so grab that if you'd like to make some of the movements harder. Starting from a comfortable seated position with quick finger and wrist warm up, we will then move through dynamic and static postures, such as squats, half moon, warrior 3, goddess pose, high lunge with the spine rotation (and more!) combining strength-building and mobility-enhancing movements.

This routine is a thoughtful blend of yoga-inspired movements, strength exercises, and flexibility drills, ensuring an effective workout designed to the needs of climbers.

I invite you to show up 7 days in a row, for around 15 to 20 mins per day. Each day we will focus on a different part of the body exploring the strength and mobility in that area. 

On Day 1 we focus on the lower body - hips, hamstrings, thighs and calves. First exploring different variations of the 90/90 to warm up the legs, specifically the hip area, following with balance standing postures such as squeezing the block with the heel and glute to activate the hamstrings and calves.

Playing with standing splits and pistol squats, as always embracing those wobbles.  

Finishing with a couple of mindful breaths. 

Showing up consistently is beautiful.. and powerful🔥

Thank you for practising together.

You can decide yourself what intensity and speed you'd like to choose when lowering the object and picking it up back again.

Curious exploring and let me know how it goes!

Yoga with Ieva Luna,KWK-ze8_-8U,20 min Strong & Dynamic Flow | Full Body Yoga with Emphasis on Shoulders & Legs,20:08,1.2k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWK-ze8_-8U,"Join me for this 20 minute strong and dynamic yoga flow where we use the block/brick or a similar object. It's a full body class with a focus on the arms, shoulders as well as legs. 

Throughout the whole class we are holding the object in between our hands to invite some novelty into the movement and to spice the practice up. 

From shoulder joint halo's to passing the block around the body in the beginning of the practice in a seated position to then exploring standing postures (such as warrior three, high lunge, warrior two) while still holding the block in between the hands. 

As always, harmonising the movement with your unique rhythm of the breath, exploring the body, the movement, and hopefully playfully challenging ourselves through this flow.

I had so much fun filming this session and I hope you enjoy it as well!

This class has no standing postures, we do all the movements on the ground in a seated position, laying on the back and on all four.

We start the practice with spine flexion and extension, gentle neck stretches, followed by puppy pose, spine twist as well as various stretches for hamstrings, hips and thighs. 

Hope you enjoy this nourishing routine!

In rock climbing strong back body helps us to heel hook, to keep our feet on the wall as well as to push through that foothold when we want to reach a higher handhold above. Strong posterior chain might also help to prevent lower back, knee and hamstring injuries.

PNF is a 'contract - relax your muscles' method, which is best done AFTER a training, climbing etc. session when you are properly warmed up. 

The research paper says that if done several days per week it might increase your range of motion (ROM) and flexibility.

However, if done prior to the exercise PNF routine might decrease your performance of high intensity exercises where maximal muscle effort is required. For example if you want to lift weights, climb, jump - do the PNF stretching routine after your training session, not before.

Yoga with Ieva Luna,wpGhL_HuUmQ,20 min PNF Stretching Routine | Lower Body Flexibility | Contract - Relax Method,23:03,9.6k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpGhL_HuUmQ,"PNF inspired Lower Body Stretching Routine! This will be juicy, friends🦁

PNF is a 'contract - relax your muscles' method, which is best done AFTER a training, climbing etc. session when you are properly warmed up. 

The research paper says that if done several days per week it might increase your range of motion (ROM) and flexibility.

However, if done prior to the exercise PNF routine might decrease your performance of high intensity exercises where maximal muscle effort is required. For example if you want to lift weights, climb, jump - do the PNF stretching routine after your training session, not before.

In this session I share some ideas that you can incorporate into your warm up before climbing routine. 

Warm up should consist of three parts:

1. Create heat in your body/ Increase your heart rate (jump rope, sun salutations, cycling, etc)
2. Rotate your joints (controlled arm, hip circles etc), activate your muscles and do some active stretching (leave static stretching after climbing or for your rest day)
3. Easy climbing on the wall 

How do you usually warm up before climbing? Share in the comments below!

In climbing we pull with our biceps more than we push with our triceps (unless there are lots of mantle moves in the climbing route🙈). 

To keep our shoulders, elbows and wrists healthy, balance between push and pull is necessary. Therefore, in this Antagonist Yoga practice, on the contrary to climbing, we will push the ground away from us.

There will be few options where you could add a little resistance band around your fingers or take some weights into your hands to make the movement harder.

P.s. If you are climbing, do you strengthen your pushing muscles? If you are practising yoga asana, do you train your pulling muscles?

Enjoy the practice and as always, let me know what you think 💚

We will fire up our abdominals, obliques, TVA (deep core muscles) as well as glutes, hip flexors and back muscles. So, yes, core is more than our abs! It is our whole midsection, the centre of our body.

Strong core improves our posture, stabilises and supports our body in all daily activities. In rock climbing, our core activates every time we pull, dyno, high step or do rock overs. Strong core provides stability, helps to bring our legs back on the wall on overhanging terrain and allows to keep our body closer to the vertical wall. 

Enjoy the session, and as always - let me know how it goes 🧘🏽‍♀️

With this lower intensity yoga routine for climbers, you will strengthen your non-climbing muscles to maintain muscular balance. You will also lengthen tighter spots as well as massage your palms, forearms and shoulders that might feel tense after a climbing session.

During the practice, remind yourself to breathe calmly, steady and lightly in order to relax your parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest response instead of fight and flight).

In rock climbing strong back body helps us to heel hook, to keep our feet on the wall as well as to push through that foothold when we want to reach a higher handhold above. Strong posterior chain might also help to prevent lower back, knee and hamstring injuries.

We hike, climb, laugh, squat, dance, learn, move, hang, pull, listen, support, swim, jump, fly, crawl, train, share and smile.

After the first Moonlight Yoga retreat in El Chorro in May I created a blog article (you can find it on my website, link below), this time to change things up - I compiled moments together into one home made video. No videos of us actually practicing yoga, as I don't film my students during the practice.

So much gratitude, inspiration and motivation still within me for those six days of being, sharing, learning and connecting with El Chorro gang in September.

I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful, supportive and positive group!

Svadhyaya (स्वाध्याय) is a Sanskrit term meaning self-study or self-reflection, one of the five Niyamas in the Eight Limbs of Yoga. Rooted in the teachings of Patanjali, it invites us to explore both spiritual wisdom and the introspection needed for personal growth and self-awareness.

This full body rejuvenation workout was designed for all expecting mothers in all trimesters to enjoy yoga and fitness while pregnant. We will start with a prenatal safe core workout, glutes, legs & finish with the upper body.  Remember to listen to your body, breathe deeply, and avoid any movement or posture that doesn't feel right in this moment in your life.

It is incredibly important to listen to your body at all stages of your journey, bringing life into the world. If it is telling you to sit out, a stretch doesn't feel right at this time, or part way through if you need to stop completely... all of this is PERFECTLY ok, and you should listen and understand that this is just how you are in this moment right now.  If you try again in an hour, or a day, or a week, it is incredibly likely your body then will give you different messages based on where you are at then too. 

So experiment with yourself. Listen carefully. Drink lots of water. And take this well deserved 30 minutes to let go and just have fun. :)

This class was designed for expecting mothers in all trimesters to enjoy yoga & fitness while pregnant. Through a series of completely pregnancy safe and customizable exercises and stretches, we will gently push our body to release tension, stress, and any sore muscles or unbalanced aspect of our entire beings. 

It is incredibly important to listen to your body at all stages of your journey, bringing life into the world. If it is telling you to sit out, a stretch doesn't feel right at this time, or part way through if you need to stop completely... all of this is PERFECTLY ok, and you should listen and understand that this is just how you are in this moment right now.  If you try again in an hour, or a day, or a week, it is incredibly likely your body then will give you different messages based on where you are at then too. 

So experiment with yourself. Listen carefully. Drink lots of water. And take this well deserved 30 minutes to let go and just have fun. :)

By letting go of any negative, stagnant energy and focusing on the light and love within us, we will find protection from any external disturbances. Using our breath as an anchor in this present moment. 

We will hold space for any emotions that have been holding us back, observing them with compassion and kindness and letting them go, allowing space for positivity and grounding. Finding deep clarity and sense of connection, and remembering that we are the light.

Mantra: Through love, I return home to my heart. I am loved, supported and guided.

Enjoy this moment of mindfulness.

And this 15 minute abs class is going to activate your whole midsection plus get your heart pumping to stimulate fat-burning while targeting all the muscles of your core from your pelvic floor to your back, obliques, and, yes, the six pack abs.

Through a challenging yet energizing plank sequence paired with mat-based core exercises, this abs workout is the best way to tighten and tone your midsection, building strength & definition while improving posture, balance, and stability.

Get ready to feel the burn! And remember, when it comes to working out your abs, quality over quantity is best! So even though this is a short class, it's super effective.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,ltE8w4SSDJs,Yin Yoga for Upper Body | Release ALL Stress & Tension In 30 Minutes,33:17,184k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltE8w4SSDJs,"This 30 minute upper body Yin Yoga class will provide immediate relief for your sore or painful upper back, neck, shoulders, arms, and chest. Through a series of mindfully deep muscle releasing asanas in this Boho Beautiful Yoga sequence, Mark Spicoluk will provide you the tools & space necessary to target all that is no longer serving you in order to first recognize it, then breathe through it, and finally ... find your liberation.  

Yin Yoga is about breath. It's about following your breath to create the space necessary to ultimately reconnect to your inner stillness. Inside that stillness yin yoga allows you to cultivate peace with whatever is going on inside both your mind and body surrounding that stillness, in order to find acceptance, forgiveness, and then ultimately complete deliverance from it. 

So throughout this class, remember to use your breath as the string to guide you back to your deliberate attention and conscious awareness ... for those are the gateway to all that you are looking for. 

So grab your mat, and some water, and don't forget to work hard and have fun.

This 10 minute meditation will give you the space for mindfulness & mental clarity necessary to ground yourself perfectly in a clean start and a fresh slate, in order to create and access all that you need for a deep feeling of control and fulfillment. 

Taking the initiative every morning to find a quiet space to sit with yourself in stillness and meditate is one of the most simple and easy gifts that we can award to ourselves. This is because the space created each day only becomes stronger and more clear over time, and therefore more valuable for you to come back to yourself each time, strengthen your conscious focus, and then continue on with clarity and momentum into all that needs to be done in the day ahead. 

May you have the best day that you deserve. 

Love & Light....

Through a series of asanas and mindful breathing we will journey inward to reconnect to the working of our own consciousness & the beating of our own heart, and remove ourselves from the memory and imprints of all that we experienced throughout the day.  

There is no greater tool than yoga to set yourself up for a perfect sleep and a wonderful beginning in the morning once again. 

Remember to drink a lot of water and when your mind wanders away always use the breath as the string to pull it back into focus. 
Also to breathe deep and have fun.

Salamba Sirsasana comes first through strength building, then balance, and always safety ... and no matter what level of yogi you are this Boho Beautiful yoga class can guide you to a perfect headstand execution. 

One of the main ideas of inversions like this is to experiment with your body and have fun. Yes, thats right ... just like when we were all kids the idea is to find joy in both being upside down and falling from time to time. Both are ideas for many years now, most of us have been told we grow out of, however when we reintegrate them into our lives with joy, curiosity, and self love a whole new and familiar world opens up. 

So please 
Remember to listen to your body... 
DON'T push past your comfort zone.

Aimed to release physical restrictions but also at relaxing your mind, through these asanas you will also let go of any negative energy, fear, stress, or anxiety. 

Do this yoga class for lower body at the end of the day, post training, or after a busy work day to gift you and your body 30 minutes of deep release and relaxation.

It is the best meditation to help you find peace with the unfolding of your life and recognize that whatever you are dealing with is only what it is until you give it the label of either good or bad.

This meditation will show you that it is up to you to give yourself the permission to go within and simply surrender to the outcome, to find peace with the moment, and let go of the illusion of control so that you can just sit in stillness with the beauty of your own life experience.

And be content with nothing more than just being.
Good or bad.
Just be.

THIS VIDEO WAS SHOT IN GUIONES COSTA RICA

***

What Kind Of Classes Are A Part Of The 14 DAY Journey Ahead? 

Our goal with this program is to offer you a variety of different styles of yoga and meditation classes.
 
YOGA
Each day a new type of 20-30 minute yoga class will be waiting for you, ranging from:

- Feel Good Vinyasa Yoga Flows

- Yin Yoga Classes 

- Power Yoga Classes

- Yoga Workouts

- Gentle & Restorative Movement 

MEDITATION

Each daily meditation will be focused on that day's theme and intention, guiding you through a 10 minute journey of connection and mindfulness.

You have the option to end your yoga practice with this meditation or fit it into a different time of day that feels best for you. 


Are you Pregnant too? I shot this entire program in trimester one! So it is trimester one safe and if you avoid any positions on your belly, it is trimester 2 appropriate too. Just listen to your body and take it easy, and if you are unsure ... consult a professional or your doctor about the specifics.

During these unprecedented isolated times turning to yoga is one of the most effective and beneficial ways to combat all the unsettling new challenges. We hope this yoga class finds its way to your heart and brings forward the value, grounding, and self-love that you deserve today. 

When you cannot go outward, it is our belief that beautiful opportunity has been created to then go inward and do the work necessary to find exactly what you thought you needed elsewhere. Because in the end everything you need is right inside of you. All that you are looking for and all that you think you are missing. Yoga is the doorway inside, just step through.

All our love... Juliana & Mark

Through the yin practice of holding yoga asanas for 3 minutes each, this at home stretch will slowly allow your body to surrender to relaxation, mindfulness, and return back to deeply rich grounded presence.  

This practice is all about slow and steady conscious breathing as well as listening to your body and watching your mind.  There is an innate balance that will slowly reveal itself to you. Do not force anything. Just let it all come forward and find stillness inside of it. That is where the great benefit will be found.

Roll out that mat and enjoy! XO

So, how will you use this difficult moment in time? 
The answer lies within you and only you.

Through mastering your strength and balance both Sirsasana and Pincha Mayurasana yoga postures can help you take your yoga class to the next level. 

No matter if you are a complete beginner or an advanced yogi this boho beautiful yoga master class is a fun way to expand your inversions. In this yoga master class, we will explore all levels, from getting into the most basic version to impressive and challenging variations. 

Inversions, when practiced mindfully, bring so much benefit to the body! Not only do they allow us to explore the body and have some play time with ourselves, but they also can relieve anxiety, remove stress, and increase focus and self-confidence. Inversions stimulate and also cleanse the systems, including increasing the metabolism. So with so much benefit attached to going upside down, adding inversions to our daily yoga practice can be extremely valuable for our health and well-being. 

Just be careful. 
DON'T push past your comfort zone.
Listen to your body.
AND make sure to put your weight on your arms NOT your actual head!

OH YEAH... and have FUN! because head-stands aren't just for the young, they are also for the young at heart!

It is a perfect tool to help cope with the uncertainty, to ground and rebalance yourself and your constantly wandering mind. 

Through the simple act of reconnecting with your inner self and practicing the idea of positive affirmations of gratitude for the simple things in life, this easy guided meditation is perfect for anyone that is needing some positivity and calm during these uncertain times. It is time to let go of the negativity, stress, anxiety....whatever is holding you back in your life. Let this class take you on a meditative journey to cleanse and heal yourself from the inside out.

As you close your eyes and virtually join me on this meditative canoe ride through the Amazon River in Peru, may you gift yourself the opportunity to let go of all that no longer serves you. Let go of the tension, the stress, the anxiety, the fear, whatever it is that is holding you back in your mind, and simply focus on that inner feeling of peace and joy that is within you. Let go and go within. 

So find a quiet space, put some headphones on, close your eyes, and enjoy.

My soul honours your soul, in seeing the light and energy within you I recognize that it is also within me, and in this we are the same. We are one. Namaste

On or off our yoga mats, each and every one of us is on our special personal journey. Yoga can be an incredible tool to further our personal growth. It in all forms can aid us to find a deeper connection within, no matter what the ""method' or 'style' we practice. With the recent popularization of yoga throughout the west and many people, including ourselves, incorporating it into our own personal livelihood, it triggers a lot of negativity from people who believe it's ""their way or the highway"". We want to share our opinion on the so-called ""yoga justice warriors"" who feel ok to expel their negativity and division onto others.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,B2wCd7FFGf8,Best Stretches For Back Pain Relief | How To Cure Back Pain,16:31,879k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2wCd7FFGf8,"These effective stretches for back pain relief are an easy and gentle path to recovery, healing, and back pain prevention. By incorporating these beginner yoga postures and movements each day, you can start rehabilitating and healing your sore back and aching or tight muscles. 

Whether you are recovering from disk herniation, sciatica pain, or any other back pain & discomfort, these yoga asanas, stretches, and exercises will slowly guide your body to better health and well-being. 

Some great yoga classes for relieving back pain:

Back Pain & Sciatica Relief
https://youtu.be/eiQjt0WSVHk

Yoga For Your Back | Strength, Recover, & Tone 
https://youtu.be/H6IsIWlSVkA

By doing these back pain relief stretches and strengthening exercises for back pain and discomfort, we will slowly bring more blood flow and oxygen into the joints and muscle tissues. 

Remember to go slow and listen to your body. If you believe you are suffering from a more serious injury like disk herniation, bulging disks, sciatica, or any other more serious injuries, PLEASE consult your doctor or physical therapist to make sure these exercises and postures are right for you. Back injury is a very serious condition that must not be taken lightly; thus if you begin to experience any shooting or sharp pain, stop the exercise and talk to your doctor before beginning any exercise.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,xCmQTR8z8j0,Wrist Pain During Yoga & Workouts | HOW TO DEAL WITH IT,11:26,130k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCmQTR8z8j0,"Wrist pain during yoga and mat based fitness is a common problem. 
We get so many questions asking how to deal with wrist pain, how to cure it, and how to manage it so we created this wrist pain tutorial video for anyone that is looking for an answer. 

Why do my wrists hurt during yoga? How do I strengthen the wrists? What can I do when my wrists become weak and begin to hurt during yoga? How do I hold my planks without wrist pain? 

A lot of the time people experience wrist pain in planks, downward dogs, chaturangas, or just generally when bearing a lot of body weight on their hands. There are ways to cope with this wrist pain by using different wrist strengthening exercises, and wrists stretching movements and postures. 

Try to include these different wrist pain solutions before or after your yoga practice and/or workouts. With time and patience the pain will get less as the body gets stronger. 

We took 10 minutes on set of our new program Boho Beautiful Retreat (http://www.bohobeautiful.life/retreat) and answered some of your questions and concerns about everything to do with wrist pain and how to manage it.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,h44voCYC6F4,"Dreams, Vision Boards, & How To Take Back Control in 2020",10:23,72k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h44voCYC6F4,"This new year 2020 is a perfect opportunity to set your dreams, visions, and goals back up and in the direction you want. For the last seven years, we have been implementing one strategy to take back control of our lives, which at the beginning of this wild ride together seemed so far out of step with what we really wanted from our life. 

But it's not a race. It's clarity. It's creating a map. And every day, checking back in on whether or not you are still on course, and then making slight adjustments always. Getting where or what you want out of life, and becoming the person you believe you can be, is a quiet and slow process of many steps. And it is a constant battle with falling down or out of step, understanding it to be a part of the journey, and then recognizing the changes to your behaviour you have to make to get back on track again. Acceptance, forgiveness, perseverance, and most of all: grace. 

That's why every new year, we create a vision board. Also known as a dream board, this single strategy has allowed us to slowly and methodically design a life and a design for ourselves as people that we are proud to constantly be walking towards. It's not magic. There is no secret. And it takes intense amounts of patience, belief, and determination. 

But most of all after this many years I think the most important idea is that we have found a deep surrender to the process... because the process is the journey... and if you get too comfortable the journey can so easily take control of you, so once in a while you have to spend a little time remembering where it is you want to go, so that you can take back control of it.

It is such a treat to be able to spend the day travelling around our favourite towns of Samara & Nosara in Costa Rica and eating delicious plant-based healthy food. Come follow us through a day in the life in Costa Rica as we recover from a long shoot in Nicaragua and reconnect with some amazing people. Pura Vida!

May we raise children ⁣⁣

The dandelion, ⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣
Children who sense ⁣⁣
the rose needs the thorn ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
And run into rainswept days ⁣⁣⁣
The same way ⁣⁣
they turn towards the sun...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
And when they’re grown ⁣⁣
& someone has to speak ⁣⁣
for those who have no voice. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
May they draw ⁣⁣
upon that wilder bond,⁣⁣⁣
Those days of ⁣⁣
tending tender things ⁣⁣⁣
and be the ones. ⁣⁣

Over the years, the two of us have been extremely grateful to have so many wonderful opportunities to explore, study, grow, and evolve our own personal yoga practice both as teachers, but more importantly, as students. And throughout this journey, it has become quite apparent to us that every teacher and every class and every moment on the mat can consistently provide new experiences, lessons, and growth. So it was with this deep understanding that we set out to create Boho Beautiful Retreat - immersed in the intention for it to be our humble contribution to anyone's journey whom we might be lucky enough to share it with. 

Boho Beautiful Retreat is a yoga journey.

An exploration.

A dedicated & motivated challenge to explore the depths of each of our own physical and mental beings, sewn together by the goal to optimize, expand, and raise the energetic frequency of this life experience.

It is a perfect way to start a new year & a new decade...

This easy gentle Boho Beautiful yoga class is perfect for beginners to release tension out of the upper body, lower body soreness, or to begin to incorporate gentle movement back into your life.

Throughout this gentle yoga practice for all levels, we will breathe, we will disconnect the mind from the daily mental noise and thought patterns, giving ourselves a moment to be one with ourselves. Whether you are a first-time yoga practitioner, or someone who is looking for a 15 minute easy yoga practice for stress release, this yoga class will give you that opportunity to take all that you need for your needs. 

Being patient and loving will be the key to this yoga practice today. Surrendering and allowing the postures to take you further into this experience of yoga, self-discovery, and inner peace. 
Remember, breathing is a very important factor in any style of yoga. So bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make.

A day in the life of Boho Beautiful as we intermittent fast, calorie count & nutrient track, and go through our daily rituals of superfood coffees, sulphoraphane skin lotions, and monitoring our daily water intake. Intermittent fasting has been one of the key components to a lot of our personal optimization, and has shown us the dirrect connection between eating in the 8-16 fasting window to increase energy, creativity, and our productivity every day. We are new to calorie tracking, but have already seen great value to counting, keeping a diary, and calculating your daily calorie intake to hit strategic dietary and healthy goals!

Come behind the scenes with us on our shoot day in Nicaragua. Shooting our new 2020 program called Boho Beautiful Retreat, as well as Pilates classes on the beach for our Youtube channel.

We are extremely excited to officially launch the pre-sale of our new program Boho Beautiful Detoxify! This 7 day clean plant based eating and Yoga Detox program resets and revitalizes your body and mind to help you find a new level of health and wellbeing.

The yoga classes in the Detoxify Program were designed with that one idea in mind. What is holding us back in life? How can we rid ourselves of all the heavy energy and limiting perceptions in order to help truly understand our truth, our power, and our potential.

The Yoga portion of our Detoxify Program became not only something we wanted to give you to fall back on whenever you feel that you need to release tension, negative energy, or stress, but also as a way to challenge the body to recognize and achieve new potentials. The classes focus on optimized movements that help achieve superficial body results like toning, sculpting, and weight loss but more importantly, within Detoxify’s Yoga agenda, each class has an intensely built in focus on your internal digestive organs via the different types of movements and asanas.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,kintmyrcmlY,BANNED From China?! | Tibet Will Now Always Have Our Heart ❤️ Boho Diary,10:19,90k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kintmyrcmlY,"BANNED From China?! | Tibet Will Now Always Have Our Heart | Boho Diary

Travelling Tibet was one of those bucket list trips for us. Visiting the Holy City of Lhasa has always been something we were fascinated with. When we finally made it over into Tibet, Lhasa was the first stop and we were forced to recognize that sometimes our expectations are simply a set up to realize that we could have never prepared ourselves for this. The challenges were not only the altitude and the climate but simply being present in an occupied nation and seeing the kindness and hospitality of the Tibetan people even after all the oppression they still suffer through today. This really motivated us to share some light on their story. We had the pleasure of meeting his Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama last year (he was forced to leave Tibet in 1959 and had been living in exile in India ever since) and now returning to his hometown of Lhasa was almost like a completion of our own personal quest to understand a part of this incredible history. 

Although Lhasa didn't live up to our imaginative expectations, once we left and began to travel through the rest of Tibet,  it was like we entered a magical story book. The nature, the animals, the people. Every day it was a new page, a new experience, and a new adventure, thus making Tibet one of the most beautiful places filled with the most magic and energy we've ever experienced. 

#TravelTibet #Lhasa #Tibet

One of the ingredients in this weight loss and detoxifying juice recipe is turmeric which is a super powerful anti-inflammatory. The main property in turmeric is called curcumin, which gives your immune system strength to fight any infection and pain that you may be experiencing. So we can definitely say that the healing properties of turmeric are worth the sacrifice! Plus, in this recipe, it is deliberately offset by other delicious ingredients.

Whether you are a first time yoga practitioner, or someone that is looking for a 20 minute deep and gentle stretch, this yoga class will give you that opportunity to take all that you need for your needs. 

Being patient and loving will be the key to this yoga practice today. Surrendering and allowing the postures to take you further into this experience of yoga, self-discovery, and inner peace. 
Remember, breathing is a very important factor in any style of yoga. So bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make.

What is Yin Yoga?

Yin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.

Suitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.

Yin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:

-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body
-Stress and anxiety reduction
-Increased circulation
-Improved flexibility
-Fascial release

Enjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,

Boho Beautiful Yoga,y9awile6Jxw,Battling My Addiction | 10 Days In 'Rehab',11:20,154k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9awile6Jxw,"There is a time when a habit turns into an addiction, and no matter how big or small, it becomes an issue. Before we can figure out a solution to cure this digital addiction, we must come to the realization that we have a problem. This is not to downplay or minimize other types of what our culture will scream are much more 'serious' physical addictions to the myriad of terrible things that we as human beings find ourselves mixed up with. Those, too, in their own right, need as much attention and loving kindness as possible. But this is to bring to light the idea that first there is a problem, and second, we need to admit it and do something about it sooner rather than later. 

The thing is, we didn't see this coming. And now it has a grip on us so bad - it snuck up like a guerrilla in the night. Its skewed individual's self worth, image, confidence and even will to live. And as a collective, even though it's hard to wrap our heads around the entirety, it's becoming clearer each day that it's affected our democratic process and played a major role in summoning and hypnotizing new violence of all kinds in our streets and in our neighbourhoods. What was once thought to bring us all together and connect us, has severed us from ourselves and each other. It's much more than anyone would have thought when we first picked up our phones, how many years ago now?

Self-awareness is the first step. Monitoring our own behaviour. Recognizing the habits, the triggers, and what the small things are that we can implement into our day to day lives which will help. There are ways to heal, we just need to arrive at the moment in our lives and realize that no one will save us from this social media trap except ourselves. 

BE CONSCIOUS OF YOUR USE
SELF-AWARENESS IS ALWAYS THE FIRST STEP TO CHANGE

Here are a few of our ideas that can help raise more self-awareness as well as give you some space necessary to start recognizing and managing the problem. 

- disconnect your social media for a week and monitor the results
- practice ""digital free sundays""
- do not check your phone for as long as possible each morning
- implement a self-imposed phone curfew every night, then shut it off
- do not sleep next to your phone... buy a real alarm clock
- leave it at home when you don't need it
- schedule time to check your phone during the day rather than it scheduling you
- turn OFF notifications
- call people or meet up with them instead of typing
- prioritize nature and leave it behind when you do
- don't charge your phone in the bedroom 
and do your best every time you reach, to be aware of why you are reaching. 

‘THE MINUTES’ CALCULATION BREAKDOWN:

Checking social media 6 times a day for ten minutes = 1 hour 
1 hour for 7 days a week = 7 hours per week

1 hour for 30 days a month = 30 hours a month
30 hours a month for a year = 360 hours a year

360 hours divided into 24 hour days = 15 days (when one day = 24 hours)

Note - After all the menial things we as humans have to do in a day (eating, bathing, bathroom, rituals, basic human tasks), we thought calculating a day as a 12 hour day was a fair (and easy) number to work with for the amount of waking hours we have available to chose what we want to spend them on. 

360 hours (on social media a year) divided by 12 hour days 
= 30 days of waking conscious ’human time.' 
AND 30 DAYS EQUALS 1 MONTH!

Therefore, 1 hour a day on social media = 1 month of a calendar year on social media 
(all from checking your social media six times a day for ten minutes each time)

Boho Beautiful Yoga,pThXSdN-kaA,When We Stopped Everything To Live With Monks ♥ Boho Diary | Kopan Monastery,12:13,101k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pThXSdN-kaA,"We found a beautiful way to spend less travelling and acquire more. Not more in experience, but more in depth. Nepal backpack travel offers so many unique ways to experience the incredible culture, mountains, trekking, and the overall Nepalese way of life. So we decided to start our backpacking Asia trip by bringing our lives to a screeching halt and committing 10 days to a Tibetan Buddhist Monastery. Our lives sometimes seem out of control. All about our devices, all about our channel, all about focusing away from ourselves and too much towards things that have unconsciously sucked us in ... so every now and then we have to do something to stop and find the reset button. To breathe and to look inside again, and see what is left to be discovered. And there is always so much. 

So there we were. At Kopan Monastery living, eating, and meditatiting with all the other students, and hundreds of Tibetan monks while taking a Discovering Buddhism Course. What a wild, deep, and meaningful experience. 

At times it was tough... structured religion and dogmatic plausible contradictions. And at other times, it was perspective altering and incredibly valuable to our own spirituality. Just like anything in life, we took what we needed from this wonderful experience of monk life. We discovered the fundamentals of Tibetan Buddhism that placed a lot of life into a beautiful perspective. We cried, we laughed, we were challenged, and we overcame it everything that was brought forward to learn a little bit more of what our Boho Beautiful life is all about.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,_B1_3CS9pj4,SOCIETY SUCKS SOULS | We Made An Escape Plan & Walked Away 🏔 Boho Diary Nepal,12:27,217k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B1_3CS9pj4,"It's been just over 3 years since we started this channel on a hell bent mission to change our life. We were definitely unhappy and felt the direction of the path that we were headed on wasn't what our souls were asking for. We knew there was more to life than Toronto. More to things than the ego-driven rat race we had found ourselves participating in. So we designed, alchemised, and began our escape. 

This journey has been a roller-coaster of extremes. But so far it has been more fulfilling, exciting, & beautiful a ride than we ever believed we could ask for. 

As we hiked the incredible mountain of Mardi Himal in Nepal, our minds began to go back in time and reflect on this journey that we've set upon. 

Thank you to our friends at Rugged Trails Nepal for the wonderful trip and guidance!

https://www.ruggedtrailsnepal.com 

May this travel blog/boho diary of our difficult Mardi Himal trek inspire anyone out there who is itching to find a way out of any situation that doesn't fill them up. Our society at times can feel like a cage, imprisoning us in a cycle of debt, bills, mortgage payments, and the constant fear that we don't have enough. Just know there is always a way out, and if there's this burn in your heart and you feel like your soul is being killed by the constant pressures of our western world, then take a moment and realize that anything is possible and that you, too, can figure out a way to pack up and leave. 

We meet people all the time who quit their corporate jobs and move to an island or a smaller town with a slower pace of life. They start a small business, an ice cream shop, they make jewelry and sell it on etsy, they run airbnb's or life coaching online business, etc..etc.

Times are not what they used to be 20 years ago; the boom of the internet has opened the door for so many self made entrepreneurs to be born. So if there's an itch in your heart and a whisper in your soul. Don't drown out the noise, but instead listen closely as it will guide you how to break free and find all that it longs for. 

Love & Light,

Juliana and Mark

There's been a lot of drama these days about vegan influencers announcing that they are not vegan anymore, or why they had to alter their vegan/plant-based diets due to their physical and mental issues. We don't want to comment on people's personal choices and controversy but we did want to address a question that many have asked us in the past, such as will we be vegan forever? How do we view the idea of being vegan? Is plant-based eating really good for you? Why are we vegan?

Overcoming and healing from a state of “burn out” is never easy. Since we’ve announced the idea that we needed to slow things down to give ourselves a moment to re-energize and find the inspiration within, we started to truly disect everything about our life that could be causing us to feel overwhelmed, over worked, and in a constant rush. Since we’ve become aware that our life was in need of some major changes, we knew it was time to create new habits which would then create more of that “needed space” for us to dig into and re-discover inspiration and motivation to be even better in every way physically and mentally possible. 

What life hacks do you do to optimize your life in every way? Comment in the video and share!

This idea has been on my mind for a while now. How our appearance, the way we look, the way we dress, the job we hold, all of these and more, create this identity that we tend to become attached to. An attachment that later on begins to bring anxiety and stress into our lives as we begin to witness this body of ours change. And that's the thing, change....the undeniable truth that each and every one of us will encounter. The more we realize that we are not these bodies, that we are not these avatars that we create, but that we are so much greater than our surface. We are energy that was energy before we came into this life and consciousness, and we are the energy that will remain after our eventual end. Once we truly accept that, maybe we can realize that life is just play and that this beautiful existence is simply just one incredible dance and experience in itself.

Focusing on the Earth Element of Air, this vinyasa based yoga class for all levels will allow you to truly connect with that inner universal life force, your prana. As we move through the gentle flow and standing yoga asanas I want you to constantly focus on deepening your inhalation and exhalation. Allowing your mind the opportunity to find the present moment through your practice. 

The element of air is all about movement, creativity, and that deeper realization that we are all a part of something greater than us. So as you slowly move and relax into this yoga practice for stress release, allow yourself to connect deeper with all that is within you. Be patient, take very yoga pose modification that you may need, breathe, and let go. This yoga is to help you let go of anything that may no longer serve you, whether that is anxiety, stress, negativity, or overall tension. So let all that energy go with each breath and enjoy. xo

So as we welcome this incredible milestone into our journey,  it's important to always be self aware of how the demands of anything you do in life play on your mental and physical well being. By all means, there's no day that goes by that we're not extremely grateful for all that has been brought to us through the Boho Beautiful community but we're also now starting to take some time to make space, recharge the batteries, re-evaluate our priorities so that we can welcome more exciting projects into our lives.

Traveling as a vegan can sometimes be challenging. With every trip we have made so far we learned more about how we can make sure we still can eat healthy from anywhere we are.

Our New Program: https://bohobeautiful.life/detoxify/ 

Eating healthy on the road comes with its challenges, especially when you are stuck on an airplane for a long time. As with anything in life, we must fail a few times to truly understand the way to succeed in situations like this. In this what we eat in a day travel video, we wanted to show you how we food prep, the challenges we face travelling vegan and how we're able to stay healthy on long journeys. Vegan healthy travel is completely doable, you just have to take your health and well-being into your own hands.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,eiQjt0WSVHk,Back Pain & Sciatica Relief ♥ Your Daily Yoga Miracle Therapy,32:27,3.1m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiQjt0WSVHk,"New Full Length Fitness Program: https://bohobeautiful.life/transform/

This 30 minute gentle yoga class is designed specifically for anyone suffering from back pain, sciatica pain, or lower body soreness. With a gentle increase of movement, yoga postures, therapeutic strength exercises, we will be gently stimulating the back muscles, stretching the glutes and hamstrings, and giving our body an opportunity to move with care. This yoga class for back pain is also great for anyone suffering from bulging disks or disk herniation.

Its very important that you listen to your body, and if your body responds well to these types of exercises, include them into your life everyday. The glute stretches are great for loosening up the muscles in case your nerve is pinched in that area. The back exercises that include gentle extensions are great for anyone suffering from disk herniation or bulging disks. Try to do these every day to strengthen the muscles around the spine, however avoid rounding out the spine and perhaps even skip the child pose if you do suffer from disk injuries. With daily commitment, with time you will begin to feel an improvement in your back and nerve pain.

During this yoga class for all levels, you will allow your mind and body to connect deeper inward, letting go of any worries or stressful thoughts and truly giving your mind and body the gift of mindful movement, stillness, and healing.  Enjoy and breathe. 

Love & Light...

This 20 minute Yin Yoga class is the perfect way to release tension and stress out of your hips as well as increase flexibility in your hamstrings and inner thighs. This slow and restorative yin yoga practice will not only release physical soreness and stiffness but also welcome any release of emotional and mental stress that you may be holding within the hip area of your body. It's important to surrender to each yin yoga posture and accept any type of emotional release that may come your way. Be patient with your body and let go. 

Remember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice, make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long, slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,iUxr6KpdggA,We Got Tattoos In Bali ♥ Some Might Say This Was A Huge Mistake?! | Boho Diary,13:17,98k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUxr6KpdggA&pp=0gcJCaIKAYcqIYzv,"We got tattoos together. In Ubud Indonesia last summer. And all that we are completely sure of is that the stars aligned and then we followed our hearts.

Big thank you to Concious Arts Tattoo Shop and Agus for your energy and incredible work! 
https://tattooswizard.com/artists/consciousartstattoos
https://www.instagram.com/tattoos_by_agus

We travelled to Ubud, Bali to work with the best tattoo artist we found online which could create beautiful spiritual imagery with vegan tattoo ink on our bodies. Getting a tattoo is a decision you make that will last a lifetime, so we really had to tune in deeper to find the right person, the right tattoo shop with the right energy to, and of course artwork that spoke to our souls. We believe Conscious Arts Tattoo Shop in Ubud Bali and Agus was the winning combination for us. Agus' dot and mandala work and the ethics of the Balinese Tattoo Shop. Tattoo art is a way to confirm our beliefs, convictions, and emotion through ink to ourselves in the future, and when we met Agus and saw what he could do we knew it was a perfect fit. That he was capable of helping create the perfect reminder for ourselves. Tattoo art to remind us to never look back and to continue to fight for progress in ourselves and the world around us every single day.

– Cordyceps: before being active (or for an energy boost without the caffeine!)

On a cold day, there is nothing better than curling up next to the fireplace with a hot drink in hand. One of our favourite hot, healthy, and cozy drinks to make is a HOT smoothie...yes that's right, hot smoothies actually exist and they are super easy to make! 
For this healthy, vegan smoothie, we have added some of our favourite superfoods to fill our bellies with good nutrients and keep our immune systems thriving!

Boho Beautiful Yoga,KKUfrIIDedQ,This Is Territorio De Zaguates  ♥ Smooches For 1100 Pooches  (Land Of The Strays),1:18,17k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKUfrIIDedQ,"Please Help The Dogs Of Territorio De Zaguates Survive & Continue... http://www.gofundme.com/bohostrays

Firstly - People are sneaking in at night and poisoning their dogs and your donations will help them secure the grounds to protect themselves. They have already lost so many dogs to this tragedy and are in desperate need to properly secure the premises by adding cameras and movement sensor lamps to the dog living areas and front gates to help protect themselves.

Secondly - Every dollar helps. In North America the average cup of designer coffee costs $5. If each of us sacrifice one coffee each, the difference that could make to the dogs and the sanctuary would be massively HUGE.  

Thirdly - if you are unable to donate at the moment, PLEASE consider sharing this video or fundraiser page on your social media. 

It costs approximately $36 dollars/month to take care of 1 dog - Territorio de Zaguates has 1100 dogs. The math is daunting at best. 

Lya and the dogs always rely on financial assistance and donations for all food, staff, and veterinary expenses, but at the moment, they're also in desperate need of improved infrastructure. Outside of securing the property from trespassers, part of the money from this campaign will go towards:

- The completion of more enclosures and roofing.
- A morgue. :(

About The Sanctuary
Territorio de Zaguates aka Land Of The Strays is a place like non-other. 378 acres of mountainous fields where 1000's of stray, injured, and abused dogs have come over the last 12 years to learn to be dogs again. The ultimate goal here is to find homes for them all, but the beauty of Land Of The Strays is that if they don't find a family, it's the perfect place for them to all live their rest of days together in freedom and happiness. 

All the dogs that have come to this beautiful sanctuary have experienced some kind of human inflicted suffering and abandonment, but here they are given a second chance. The cruelty that is done to so many of these innocent beings is unthinkable, yet the compassion that Lya and her team give to these dogs every day finds a way to heal them. With Territorio De Zaguates' numbers now rising to over 1100 free roaming dogs, the costs are rising too and Land Of The Strays needs our help.

Territorio de Zaguates aka Land Of The Strays is a place like non-other.  378 acres of mountainous fields where 1000's of stray, injured, and abused dogs have come over the last 12 years to learn be dogs again. The ultimate goal here is to find homes for them all, but the beauty of Land Of The Strays is that if they don't find a family it's the perfect place for them to all live their rest of days together in freedom and happiness. 

All the dogs that have come to this beautiful sanctuary have experienced some kind of human inflicted suffering and abandonment, but here they are given a second chance. The cruelty that is done to so many of these innocent beings is unthinkable yet the compassion that Lya and her team give to these dogs everyday finds a way to heal them. With Territorio De Zaguates' numbers now rising to over 1100 free roaming dogs, the costs are rising too and Land Of The Strays needs our help. 

It costs approximately $36 dollars/month to take care of 1 dog . They always rely on financial assistance and donations for all food, staff, and veterinary expenses but at the moment they're also in desperate need of help to cover the following expenses:

Completion of more enclosures and roofing.
A morgue.
Extensive Drainage and runoff modifications.
Elevate the entire extension of the eating troughs.
Build a properly equipped ""clinic"" area where the doctor can operate.
A shed only for cleaning materials.
A shed only for medicine.
Tags for all dogs.

ALSO- Aside from all of this, they are unfortunately in the need of equipping the entire living area of the dogs as well as the entrance to the farm with cameras and movement sensor lamps because they have recently been getting many trespassers who try to poison their dogs at night! This is requiring them to extend the original electrical layout to far regions of the area in order to secure their land from intruders, which represents a HUGE expense. 

So we ask that you open your heart to whatever you can. Nothing is too little for them and every little bit helps.  
Even just a few dollars doesn't make a difference to our individual day to day lives but to these dogs and to Lya it means the world. 

We ask that you stand with us and help Territorio de Zaguates thrive and continue to save the lives of the all the innocent pups that they are fighting to rescue every day. 

Lets support good people doing good things. 
You and I may not be able to change the entire world but together we can change the entire world of each of these dogs that is currently fighting for his/her life. 

Thank you for standing with us. Thank you for standing up for these dogs. 

And thank you for your love and support!

Travelling through the magical cities and villages of Peru's Sacred Valley was incredible. It was such an eye opening experience to be immersed in the Peruvian Inca culture, to meet so many wonderful local people, and to hear their stories of how they truly feel about this commercial boom that has been steadily transforming their world. The exploitation of their sacred plant medicine which is now offered on almost every corner, Starbucks taking out the local coffee shops, McDonalds providing jobs but at the same time destroying other local restaurants, and so many foreign companies creeping their way in to siphon so many dollars away. All of this to serve the massive amount of growing travellers descending upon their sacred spaces.  

So what's the best way to travel in Peru? Or anywhere for that matter? How do you experience the Sacred Valley but at the same time not support the elimination of their culture by the commercialistic ways of the Western world? Should we all just stay at home? Is it better to leave it all be and read about our wonderful world only in Nat Geo? Is there a solution? 

We believe there is. And not just abroad, but in our own communities too. Shop local wherever you go, support community businesses, contribute to the culture that you are surrounding yourself with. Vote with your dollars to keep them in the pockets of those who need it most. And realize that the world has so much to offer with its deep diversity and endless cultural beauty that taking a chance on something new is far more rewarding than the safe familiar road. Its up to all of us. What we value, we can keep alive.

Surrounded by amazonian jungle, tucked away on the Amazon River, we filmed this Day In The Life video at the Otorongo Eco-Lodge - whose mission statement is ""Promoting the sustainable development of the environment in the Peruvian Amazon since 2016.""  Eco-tourism adventure at its finest. 
During this day in our life consisted of amazon jungle rainforest hiking, a fruit tour, swimming in the amazon river next to the pink and grey amazon river dolphins, a night river terror expedition in which we got both stuck and seemingly lost, sunrise amazon bird watching, searchign for tarantulas and poison frogs, and so much more. 

This sustainable eco lodge allowed us not only live in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way but also experience the Amazon in its raw and pure form. We also got to shoot a couple yoga videos too. 

Come along with us and see what a day in the life in the Amazon basin looks like!

We came into it with no idea of what to expect and were surprisingly blown away but the amazing energy that filled this entire festival. 

From the Envision Fest yoga classes, to the inspiring talks and speeches, amazing vegan food, their garbage program that leaves no waste behind after the festival is done, and of course our favourite Xavier Rudd. We hope that there will continue to be more festivals like this that raise the conciseness of the people, that provide gatherings for like minded people, and that honour the guiding divine light that leads us along our paths. Thank you for this unforgettable time Envision Festival, we will be back!

Boho Beautiful Yoga,FvaPi2JjnFI,"THIS Juice Cleanse ♥ My Story, Weight Loss, & New Me",10:10,300k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvaPi2JjnFI,"It’s very important that throughout our life we always find a way to challenge ourselves. Whether that is our body, our mind or both. Starting a juice cleanse was my first challenge of this year and wow was it an intense journey. It first started as a 3 Day Juice Cleanse and then as day 3 arrived I really felt amazing results, so I kept going and made my 3 day Cleanse to a 7 day Raw Juice Cleanse.


JUICE RECIPES

THE GREEN SUNRISE 
This juice is a great way to start your morning off. It's a heavy vegetable juice with a ton of dense nutrients and a great flavour to help push your body to realize that even with out solid food it can still get all that it needs.

Broccoli- 1/2 a stock of broccoli (stem and all)
Spinach- 1/2 a bunch of spinach
Passion Fruit- Entire fruit (no skin!)
Lemon- 1/2 lemon (rinds and seeds)
Cuccumber- 1/2 to 3/4 cucumber
Add ice to make it come alive. 

THE GREEN BULLET
This juice was awesome. I had it everyday at 11am as a natural sugar life (the pinnacle) and internal reboot (the cayenne). 

Kale - 1/2 a bunch
Ginger- a little chunk
Lemon - 1/2 lemon including seeds and rind
Pineapple - 1/4 to 1/2 a pineapple 
Cucumber- 1/2 to 3/4 of cucumber
Top and stir in 1 table spoon of Cayenne Pepper 
Add ice to really make it refresh.

TUMMERIC FOR DAYS
The main purpose of this juice is the turmeric. Its great for so many reasons (google it!) but I love it for my back as an anti inflammatory. This juice was nice in the afternoon and always seemed to hit the spot. 

Orange- 1 oranges
Lemon- 1/2 lemon
Spinach- 1/4 bunch
Carrot- 2 decent sized carrots
Watermelon- 3 big slices
Turmeric-  As much as I could put in without killing the flavour completely
Fresh Black Pepper- Top the finished juice with a half table spoon of black pepper to supercharge and activate the turmeric. 
Finish with ice cubes to cool it down and make it really enjoyable. 


LIQUID V8 
This was one of the staple dinner juices I worked at getting better and better. The key was experimenting to flavours I would like and trying different combinations of nutrient heavy vegetables. It would usually be the last juice of the day and let my body know once again that it can feel full, nourished, and receive more than it needs in liquid form. 

Tomato- 1 full tomato
Broccoli- 1/2 a stock of broccoli (stock included)
Sweet Pepper- Entire pepper (green, red, or yellow)
Spinach - 1/2 a bunch 
Celery- 2 stalks of celery
Carrot- 2 decent size carrots
Beet- 3/4 beet

This was my journey on trying to live Raw Vegan for 7 days. It's important to challenge your body from time to time to truly allow yourself to understand what your body needs to thrive at its best. It's hard to say that one type of eating habit will work for everyone as all of our bodies work in different ways. As long as our choices do not harm our planet and/or take away freedom and peace from sentient beings, I believe it's important to try and experiment with different ways of nourishing ourselves to understand the best way we individually can thrive.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,iWjRCMB_mzY,Pilates Intense Mat Workout ♥ Tools For A New You | BELIEF,19:41,2.4m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWjRCMB_mzY,"This class is one of the most effective pilates workout videos we have created for both beginners and advanced. A floor Pilates workout that targets and fine tones different areas of your body which includes your core, obliques, glutes, and hamstrings. Pilates is an incredible way to accomplish real results, weather it's pilates for weight loss, pilates for core strength, or pilates for toning, you can accomplish so much for your body through this circuit of incredibly effective pilates exercises. 

This week the idea we are focussing on in Tools For A New You is ‘belief’. What you think about is what you become. Our minds are so powerful, and one of the key ideas that we must always keep within ourselves especially when we embark on any transformational journey is truly believing in ourselves and our strength. In life we will be met with resistance in many shapes and sizes. Weather that is our body’s limitations, the people around us, or your own ego telling you that achieving your goal is not possible for someone like “you”. Take a deep breath, and allow those thoughts or people around you to fade away as background noise. Find the strength within yourself and believe that no matter how hard it gets, you are strong enough and capable of achieving anything you put your mind into. Always reminding yourself that as long as you believe in it, as long as you are putting all the hard work and energy into your goals and dreams nothing can stop you from achieving that which you deserve, not even your mind. So brush off the negative self talk, pick yourself up if you fall down, and never stop believing in the idea that you deserve to live a happy, healthy, and prosperous existence.

This is a perfect yoga class to do after a long day at work or a stressful week. By using different yin yoga postures we will focus on releasing tension and stiffness out of the back and hips. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. This yin yoga class is great for beginners or anyone that is looking for something very gentle on the body.  You can even do this yoga class in bed if you like. 
 
Dedicate this 20 minutes to yourself, because you deserve it! Put your own self care as a priority. Breathe, let go of all the negativity in your life, and welcome new positive and vibrant energy with every new breath.

Pilates is an incredible way to accomplish real results, weather it's pilates for weight loss, pilates for core strength, or pilates for toning, you can accomplish so much for your body through this circuit of incredibly effective pilates exercises. 

This week the idea we are focussing on in Tools For A New You is 'focus'. What you think about is what you become. And what you focus on regularly is what you will accomplish. So weather its a fitness or yoga goal, or a general better balance of health and wellness, or any type of dream or goal in your life... write it down, set your intention, and every day ask yourself what you can do to focus on one more small baby step to get you where you need to be. Each day is an inch in the journey, and in time the inches get easier, and eventually turn into feet and then miles. It won't be easy, but commit to the idea, write it down, and every day remind yourself again and again. Before you know it the results will give you momentum. And with momentum it begins to come with ease. And eventually you will be where you want to be.

If you are looking to improve your flexibility, let go of tension and stress, and release the connective tissues in your body, then this yin yoga program is the one your mind and body needs. Yin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice. Each class of this program will be focused on a specific idea or intention to not only help you release tension physically but also let go of negativity, self criticism, and non-positive thinking. 

A portion of all sales of this program will be directly donated to The Save Elelphant Foundation.

This yin yoga program was shot at Elephant Nature Park in Chaing Mai Thailand, at The Cambodia Wildlife Sanctuary 1 hour outside of Siem Reap, and at a blissful Pagoda just north of Siem Reap.

This 20 min Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. By using different yin yoga postures we will focus on releasing tension and stiffness out of the upper back, hips, and glutes. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make.
 
Dedicate this 20 minutes to yourself, because you deserve it! Put your own self care as a priority. Breathe, let go of all the negativity in your life, and welcome new positive and vibrant energy with every new breath. 

Relax, go deep, enjoy xo

Through this digital nomadic lifestyle we finally got to experience what ""vanlife"" was truly about. The ups and downs of tiny living, to exhausting drives, to uplifting human connections... all of this was something we will forever remember.

Shot in Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park, in Canada. We are so happy to now be sharing this easy guided 15 minute meditation with you now. 

🚨 Check out our NEW youtube channel dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditations 🚨 
https://flow.bohobeautiful.life/BohoBeautifulMind-

New moons and solar eclipse's are perfect moments to start again, to heal, and to rebalance oneself. And we hope that this guided meditation will give you what you need right now. Weather that be learning to meditate and beginning to grow the foundations of meditation, or as part of your everyday meditation practice. ♥

Each and everyone one of us comes across a time in our lives when we are in need of healing. May it be physically, emotionally, or even spiritually. Our minds are more powerful then we give them credit. Once we recognize that we can truly heal ourselves with our thoughts, and the energy we surround ourselves with, we start to live and see the world from a different perspective.

Find a comfy spot, put on some headphones, and join me in our Meditation for Healing.

They did not pay for this video. We made an arrangement where they would plant a tree for every mile we drive and we would make a video about it. We have never been more happy and proud of something we have been able to accomplish with our Yoga practice.  Because that's over 9000 trees being planted for the earth!  

We are currently driving all over the USA in our converted camper van...yup living the van life. Doing charity yoga classes in benefit of different local non-profit organizations. Our boho life has moved from wild South East Asian adventures to amazing forests, desserts, and landscapes of America. To see if we're coming to a city near you check out this link below:

Combing PIlates core exercises with Yoga postures, this class will get you toned and stretched. 

We were lucky enough to do one of our Yoga events on our Boho Beautiful Positive Movement Tour stops at the Out To Pasture Sanctuary in Estacada, Oregon. After the event we had the incredible opportunity to film a yoga class with some of their beautiful animals. OTP is a great example of two people who dedicated all their time and energy to saving animals and helping others. It is so inspiring to have the opportunity to spend time with such people that do such incredible things, all out of the goodness of their hearts. 

Enjoy the class and the mini doc! xo

It has been a dream of ours and thanks to our friends Kyle & Sarah it turned into reality- we are ready to tour the states!              
 
Our store: https://bohobeautiful.life/our-store/

We have embarked on a new journey- camper van life. As we prepared to travel through North America in our van for our Positive Movement Tour, we had some help from our friend Kyle and his wonderful wife Sarah to convert it into an incredible tiny home on wheels. 9000 miles in our stealth camper converted van, we are truly experiencing a new nomadic lifestyle. Oh... and this tiny home has solar power!

How to handle the nomadic van lifestyle is a new territory we are exploring, which includes embracing minimalism, tiny living, and stealth camping wherever we can. But so far it has been nothing but incredible memories and adventures since we sold everything we owned and drove off into the unknown.  in full. Here's to new sunsets and sunrises. And we hope you enjoy our Incredible van conversion & tiny living tour XO

It wasn't easy but we have decided that we would rather tie it up properly than let the Boho Diary Series go on for too long.  That is not to say we might not start a second series down the line just like it, and we are definitely NOT stopping making youtube content for you all, but we are peacefully putting the final chapter of this series out into the universe. 

Thank you so much to every single one of you who connected, enjoyed, and allowed our journey in South East Asia to affect you in any way at all. We will continue bringing you all more yoga, fitness, food, life, and meditation videos however, as far as Boho Diaries go, this is it for a while. 

Having to returned to North America we are now about to embark on a new adventure, The Boho Beautiful Positive Movement Tour 2017! 40 stops across USA, 3 months on the road in our van with our dog. A new van life ahead of us with triumphs, struggles, new connections, and memorable experiences. 

 Here’s to new adventures and never forgetting the past adventures that got us here. XO

It's hard not to feel saddened by all the poverty we see on a daily basis through travelling through many South East Asian countries. Cambodia hit us hard emotionally by what we saw and experienced, however whenever life gets us down we look up towards the good people doing good things. Allowing their energy to inspire us to have faith and to never give up on trying to bring some light into this darkened world. 

Here's to amazing people, dedicating their lives to make this world a better place. And to all the wonderful Cambodians we met who were so happy, giving, and beautiful.  xo

This 20 minute Vinyasa flow is the perfect practice to start your day with. Moving through a faster pace flow, this class will wake up your system, boost your metabolism, and get your mind and body ready to tackle anything that comes your way through the day. 

As we move through this practice we will be joined by beautiful rescued elephants enjoying their river bath and bamboo snacks, as well as our cute 3-legged dog (who is a survivor from a jungle poaching accident). These animal's inspiring power and will to survive through the circumstances they were rescued from is the energy that will allow us to find the power within ourselves. To grow, and become better then we were yesterday.

Living on an island where dogs rule the beaches and motor bikes are your only way of transportation has taught us a lot. There's something really special in finding a routine that fuels your mind, body, and soul. Once you find that, never let it go. Let it help you grow in ways that allows you to find more meaning and purpose in every breath you take. And when you falter from it, as we always will, accept the step back and take two more forward as you should- remembering how you found it or maybe even how it found you.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,KuKJ6TYJ5N4,"For The Love Of Elephants, Please! ♥ Boho Diaries | Ep.11 Elephant Haven Thailand",9:23,51k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuKJ6TYJ5N4,"Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to all the incredible donors, people that shared our video, and simply spread the word about the current elephant crisis going on in this world. The money we raised together with you guys may not change the world, but it will change these elephants world. SO again thank you for opening your hearts and wallets. This is just the beginning....until every chain is broken. 

Elephant Haven Thailand (Kanchanaburi) is part of the Elephant Nature Park organization based in Chang Mai, and although Elephant Haven was once a trekking camp providing tourists with elephant riding and entertainment, it has since been converted into a place where elephants can recover in peace and be elephants again. 

The business of people using Elephants to acquire easy tourist dollars is ugly, abusive, shameful, and unfortunately quite profitable… but places like Elephant Haven & Elephant Nature park serve both as sanctuaries for these animals and as necessary experiential education for tourists and animal lovers alike. They help shine a light on the need for us to reevaluate our relationships to this planet’s most wonderful creatures.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,N3NLqJLbsgo,"Ultimate Butt Challenge ♥ Glutes, Hamstrings & Quads | Koh Kut",21:38,2m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3NLqJLbsgo,"Challenge Description Below!!

Back by popular demand this is your ultimate ""butt lift, glute building, leg toning - whatever you prefer to call it"" challenge! If you stick to this challenge you will begin to see incredible definition and toning in that area of your body. This workout is not going to be easy so please be patient with yourself. As the muscles get stronger, the exercises will get easier and the results will begin to show.

 Don't worry if you have to take breaks or even stop during the exercises for the first week or so. Its completely normal to feel your muscles become fatigued, therefore adding some of the recommended yoga classes along with the challenge is highly recommended to avoid muscle soreness. 

Be strong, be patient, work hard, and have fun!

♥ DAY OFFS ♥ 
This is your time to let the muscles rest. However, including a yoga class will make sure the muscles get time to recover and release any built up lactic acid through deep yoga stretches. So pick one class from the suggested video list below each week to choose a yoga video thats right for you. 

♥ CHALLENGE GUIDELINES ♥
  
♥ Drink at least 2 L of water per day through the challenge.

♥ Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. 

♥ And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean.  I eat a plant based diet which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,pL1RWA_Qavs,Yin Yoga Class ♥ Release Stress & Feel Amazing in 30 Minutes | Borneo,29:22,2.5m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL1RWA_Qavs,"This Yin Yoga class is one of the best ways to not only increase flexibility in your legs and hips but it will also help you release any stored up negative energy in your body. Emotional energy, (if not dealt with or released) overtime will manifest as physical illness in your body. Whether that is as sickness, or simple muscles aches and tension. 
By holding each posture in this yin yoga class bring your awareness to anything that you believe no longer serves you. As you exhale, visualize this negative energy leaving your body and breath in positive and peaceful energy. Releasing any stress or worry and filling your mind and body with positive high frequency vibrations. 

What is Yin Yoga?

Yin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.

Suitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.

Each posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. 

Yin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:

-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body
-Stress and anxiety reduction
-Increased circulation
-Improved flexibility
-Fascial release

Enjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,

Juliana & Mark

Boho Beautiful Yoga,RttVsGmQjIA,Yoga For Splits ♥ Release Tight Hips & Increase Leg Flexibility,21:59,1.5m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RttVsGmQjIA,"This yoga flow is perfect for those of you that have always wanted to achieve the splits or if you’re simply looking to gain more flexibility in your legs and open up the hips. The different postures that will be included in this particular flow will help you loosen the hamstrings, loosen tight hips, and let go of any tension within your lower body. If you are looking to attain fast results in your leg flexibility, we highly recommend doing this video at least 4-5 times per week so you can really start to train and loosen the lower body. A great time to do this flow would be after a tough workout or in the morning when you want to get the juices flowing and the body fully awake to start the day. 

Make sure you take your time with the stretches. Don’t push too much, too fast. Try to attain a position where you are able to hold the posture without too much pain. Speaking of pain, never push through any sharp, electric, or shooting pain. That is what we call the “bad pain” as it is usually your body letting you know that you are going too far for what it can handle and this can potentially cause injury. Listen to your body, breathe, and take your time. Be patient, stay dedicated to daily practice and you will get the results you are looking for. 

Namaste XO

As many of you may have heard, there has been a lot of changes happening on Youtube. These changes are causing many creators to either close down their channels, or quit doing Youtube videos all together.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,r_W49tWhVys,Pilates Workout Challenge ♥ Get Ready For Summer In 14 Days | Padar Island,19:29,2.6m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_W49tWhVys,"It’s that time of year for a lot of people where the Winter coats are coming off and Summer is approaching. This Pilates 14 Day Challenge was created for anyone that is looking to gain more strength, tone the stomach, build a firmer butt, and who is ready to welcome the Summer with full force. I’ve carefully designed this challenge to help you achieve great results in just 14 days of fully committing to completing all the videos suggested as well as keeping a clean and healthy diet. 

This pilates video is paired with a different video each day to help you burn fat, tone the muscles, and build flexibility. Its all about making that one commitment to yourself. To dedicate 30-45 minutes each day to you. To breathe, to stretch, to challenge the body to new levels which with time will only bring amazing results, strength, and energy to your everyday life. 

Read the description carefully and have fun!

Being mindful of your breath as you move and hold each posture. With each exhale letting go of any negative stressful energy and with each inhale bringing in positive, peaceful, and warm energy. 

It's important for each of us to take a moment for ourselves each day. Whether it be in the morning, afternoon or evening. A simple 15-20 minute self time out will help you rebalance your mind, body, and spirit. 

So find a quiet space, turn off your phone, and join me on this beautiful deserted island in be Gili Islands of Indonesia.

Before leaving Bali and moving onward to the Gili Islands we found the coolest eco-friendly home that we had the pleasure to stay in. In the middle of a rice field, surrounded  by chickens, cows, and ducks, it was an incredible escape from the busy streets of Ubud. 

Come inside for a little tour! ;)

This yoga class can even be done without a yoga mat (only if you wish) as you will be moving through standing and balancing asanas. 

A great practice to use to ground yourself, re-energize, and tone your legs. Just remember to always breathe through each pose. Keep your focus in balancing postures by looking at the floor or whats in front of you. Clear your mind, stay present, and dedicate a little bit of time to your health and well-being.

Moving to the Rocky Mountains was wonderful and it gave us a moment to stop and take a breath, but now we're in need of more then just a breath of fresh air, we're in need of learning how to breathe again. 

We have finally arrived in Bali. Reflecting on the years and the last few months that brought us here has begun to make it quite apparent that we have our work set out for us. And not work such as our business and brand, but self work. Self work through self care will truly be the theme of the next few months. 

May we look back at this period of our life one day and continue to smile. ♥

Thank you for being here with us... 

Love,
Juliana and Mark

Boho Beautiful Yoga,Iv2ECs8pVqk,Guided Meditation: Acceptance Of The Present Moment,15:35,809k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2ECs8pVqk,"This 15 minute meditation was created to help you with any anxieties or fear of the future and/or the past. Each of us has a certain image of how we see our life becoming and coming to be, however sometimes life works in ways that we are given something we may not want or agree with. We see it as a set back and sometimes let it affect our lives negatively attracting more negative energy than we asked for. 

🚨 Check out our NEW youtube channel dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditation 🚨 
@BohoBeautifulMeditation 

This meditation is meant to help you find acceptance with what is. Not fighting it but truly accepting each present moment as it is given to us by the universe. Find peace, contentment, and acceptance that everything has a reason behind it. Weather it is a lesson to be learnt, a push to change our life in a new direction, or perhaps a realization of who is truly true to us. 

Find a quiet comfortable position. Put some headphones on, and let yourself become emerced in this peaceful state for 15 min.

While staying in Invermere we figured, why not try to go to all three in one day. And so it went... 

Lucia Hot Springs is a natural hot spring which comes out of a rock bed and flows into the river. Fairmont is owned privately. And Radium is part of Kootenay national park.

In the end our bodies felt like tapioca pudding but it was definitely a day well spent. We slept incredibly well that night. :) 

love and light,
... Juliana & Mark*

Life in the mountains has been wonderful but we are getting a little tired of this cold so where off to plan out next adventure. We shot this video in the middle of Lake Louise in Banff National Park, in Alberta Canada, and also on the ground of The Fairmont Lake Louise. We came here in hopes that the weather would be good enough to shoot outside and then we were hit by a blizzard. Even though, many thanks to the good people there for giving us permission!

Would love some recommendations from you guys on the places we should visit, stay, and shoot in throughout the Pacific and beyond! Comment below!!

Boho Beautiful Yoga,oNYCAxdaKGU,Giving Up Everything To Wanderlust ♥ Boho Diaries | Ep 2. Invermere BC,11:05,89k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNYCAxdaKGU,"Our first days of being free. Living in an off the grid cabin in the mountains. :)

Well, we've made it to our first temporary home, an off the grid cabin in the Rocky Mountains. We have finally finished the long two week drive through snowy Canada and are excited to settled for a short time before we take off again. 

Living off the grid is a new experience for us that's for sure, however, we are starting to really love it here. 

A simpler way of life. Starting to remember what's it's like to listen to real silence again, look at a sky covered with sparkling stars, experiencing the deep freeze of the mountains, and allowing that feeling that we're not coming back truly set in. 

Hope you enjoy Part 2 of the Boho Diaries. We made it to our first stop, where to next...?

Love,

Mark and Juliana

Boho Beautiful Yoga,AhITIKFruHM,Challenge Your Waistline ♥ Abs & Core Workout Plan,12:16,2.2m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhITIKFruHM,"This 21 day Ab Challenge is a little different then some of the other challenges that we've done before. So read the description carefully, and get ready to sweat!


The Rules:
The only rule to this challenge is that everyday you're going to push yourself a little further then the day before. So grab a pen and paper so at the end of each day you can keep track of where you stopped to reference when you start the next day. 


The Schedule: 
The schedule for this challenge will be 2 days of core work and 1 day of yoga for 3 weeks. which will mean your core is becoming stronger and stronger with each day! 


The Goal:
The goal here is to build the strength in your core, to trim the waistline, and to help you get that ab definition a lot of us strive to achieve. 


DAY ITINERARY:

Day 1: 
Do this workout as far as your feel the strength of your body can take you, and then stop. If you stop three minutes in, thats completely ok. If you finish the entire class once through completely, start it up a second time and continue till you have to stop. Listen to your body, and make sure to stop when it tells you. 

Day 2: 
Do it again, but use the day before as a marker point and make sure you make it to at least to the same spot if not further. 

Day 3: 
Take a break and replace this workout with any of the following yoga classes below...

Relaxing Yoga For Peace ♥ 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYiV4ztPVu0

Day 4: 
Come back to this class and make sure you go even further than the last time you did it (Day 2). 

Day 5 & Onward:
Continue to cycle two days of this video and one day of yoga for 21 days. Always mark down where you made it to. And always make sure to match that spot or go further the next day when you come back to this class. 

REMEMBER- 
If you make it to the end of the class, you are not done yet! You have to start the class up again and go until you have to stop. That's the name of the game. 

Good luck with the challenge! Let us know how it goes for you... let's get those abs nice and strong!!

♥ CHALLENGE GUIDELINES ♥

♥ Rest days include a yoga session so you can stretch those sore   
    muscles

♥ Drink at least 2 L of water per day through the challenge.

♥ Include at least one dark green leafy salad per day.

♥ Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. 

♥ And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean. I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us...

Boho Beautiful Yoga,b317a0JcnwU,We Sold Everything & Left ♥ Boho Diaries |  Ep 1. Goodbye Toronto,12:40,400k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b317a0JcnwU,"Yes, it is true. We have sold all of our belongings, quit our jobs in Toronto, bought a used van, got our dog, a suitcase each, some filming gear and off we go.

Life has blessed us with opportunities so that we can make a step forward in exploring this beautiful unpredictable adventure called life. And our hearts are filled with pure gratitude for how this amazing adventure has opened up for us.

Is it scary to leave like that? I can’t say it’s not. Its scary changing your life. Stepping forward into the complete unknown, without a plan, a security line, or a plan B ready to be played. But at the same time I’ve never felt so liberated in my life. And every time someone asks so where will you go next, it’s thrilling to hear ourselves stutter on the words, “we don’t know.”

No more attachments, just our love, our dog, and this beautiful experience of existence. We’re about to drive upon an empty road that will lead us to beautiful, adventurous, frighting, and awakening experiences.

Follow our diaries...

Love,

Mark and Juliana

This practice moves through different postures that will open your hips and release any hamstring tension. A great class to do after a long travel day or after you've been sitting at an office desk for longer than you should be. 

If any pose feels too much for you feel free to modify or skip anything that doesn't feel right. Most importantly we want you to feel good no matter where you are in your posture. 

Remember to breathe, let go, and simply stay present in each moment of this practice!

♥ CHALLENGE GUIDELINES ♥

♥ Rest days include a yoga session so you can stretch those sore   
    muscles

♥ Drink at least 2 L of water per day through the challenge.

♥ Include at least one dark green leafy salad per day.

♥ Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. 

♥ And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean. I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire. 

                       ----------------------------------------­­­­­­------------------------

Best of luck with the challenge and remember to use the hashtags below so we can all stay connected and motivate one another to keep pushing through the next 21 days of awesome work!

Boho Beautiful Yoga,-fac_iJ8Nw8,Yin Yoga Fusion  ♥ Best Yoga For Flexibility,25:54,3.4m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fac_iJ8Nw8,"This Yin Yoga Flow class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. Focusing on fusing Vinyasa based flow (Yang) with slow and tension releasing postures (Yin), this class is great to do in morning as well as anytime during the day as we focus on first warming up the body with a flow, and then taking it into a deep release by holding each Yin pose for 2 minutes. 

Remember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. 



What is Yin Yoga?

Yin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.

Suitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.

Each posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. 

Yin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:

-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body
-Stress and anxiety reduction
-Increased circulation
-Improved flexibility
-Fascial release

Enjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,

Juliana & Mark

♥ CHALLENGE GUIDELINES ♥

♥ Rest days include a yoga session so you can stretch those sore   
    muscles

♥ Drink at least 2 L of water per day through the challenge.

♥ Include at least one dark green leafy salad per day.

♥ Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. 

♥ And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean. I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us...

Boho Beautiful Yoga,4d6-hzxiMO4,Go All The Way ♥ Our Bohemian Soul Diary,2:36,54k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d6-hzxiMO4,"Looking back our life was in a difficult place. To put it simply, we were lost.  Not sure what exactly our purpose was together here on this planet. Doing jobs just so we can pay bills and get by. Afraid of speaking up, afraid of committing ourselves to something, refusing to listen to the voice deep down in our hearts whispering to us in the quiet moments. 
These words came from our journey of soul searching, journaling, and feeling. Our thoughts put on paper to be spoken later aloud. They came from failing numerous times and getting back up to try again. From overcoming our fears to pursue something we both felt passionate about. And here we are now. Still growing, still learning, still falling on our face and getting back up... but isn't that was life is all about? Experience? A moment? To grow and evolve? 

We hope our life together and what we create via Boho Beautiful inspires you to never stop climbing the stairs. No matter how hard life can get, show up, be you, stand for what you believe in, and follow your heart. Create the life you love unappologically.

 XO
Juliana & Mark*

.go all the way.
nobody said it was going to be easy
but with each step forward i will find my way 
to seek out the forgotten me
the passions that i left behind
my truth 
my love
my light
there is no bette place to begin
because there is no better moment than this one right now
to let go
run away from the noise
speak from the heart
stand with a fist
be me with no apology 
no regrets
no fears
the first step of any journey is the hardest one
but the road is unforgettable
just me
the universe
and one singular decision
to go all the way

We went on an adventure with no purpose or destination, we just wanted to get on our motorbike and drive. So we did, and upon our journey we discovered a beautiful gem, a temple, a wonderful place that sang with peace, love, and silence. We were drawn to it, to climb it, to experience it, to be in it. So we did...

Also, this is a great class to do at the end of your workouts as it will give your muscles the stretch they need to decrease the chances of feeling sore the next morning.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,3HEwpwKq1ic,"Creating Our New Program ♥ 1 Hour Classes, Nutritional Plans, & Wanderlust",8:17,45k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HEwpwKq1ic,"Everything around us began with intention. An idea. And then the act of creation. We started a project almost a year ago. And sure we thought it would be done mush sooner, but we learned that all things take the time that they are going to take as long as you don't give up. Finding patience, motivation, and perseverance is the creative process... and this blog is another step towards our final product. 

This blog is to announce the creation of Boho Beautiful In 10 Days ! A transformational mind and body program we knew we had to make for you guys. We truly hope when we finally get there it affects you in the positive ways that we hope that it can. 

Also, we are planning the next six months of travel for ourselves. And we are quite certain we need more people's experiences around the globe to help us find new places we don't know exist that would be perfect of our channel and personal journey. This is us asking you guys around the world for advice. :)

Thank you all in advance.  



Lots of Love,

Mark & Juliana

Boho Beautiful Yoga,CiaD3jP0YhA,Advanced / Intermediate Yoga Flow ♥ Expand Your Practice,22:21,1.9m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaD3jP0YhA,"This 20 min advanced/intermediate yoga flow is for those who are looking to take their practice to the next level. However, this video has  enough modifications that it is also great as an overall full body lengthening and releasing class for anyone thats familiar with yoga. 

Take what you need from this class.   From headstands to hip opening  postures, this class will get you moving, strengthening, and challenging yourself like never before. 

But remember, be patient with yourself. As you push yourself, listen to your body and its limitations & please BE CAREFUL not to go past your own practice level. Yoga is a journey and where you are is perfect and exactly where you need to be. Challenge yourself through gentle physical challenge, concentration, and acceptance. Be ok with where you are in each pose. Don't rush it.
Just breath, let go, and have a little fun with it. ;)

So we try to create a life that allows us to enjoy more moments right now.We must all let the triumphs and set backs of life fill us with knowledge, strength, and courage. Set goals, work hard, and sacrifice short term distractive pleasures for life priorities that will bring us closer to the vision of what we see and better versions of ourselves. 

 Even though many new changes are on the way for us, our life is all about finding balance. The balance between work and play, traveling and home responsibilities, and all of the little things in life that can take us closer or further from our dreams depending on how we position them. 

We work hard to design our perfect journey.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,98L-kB8L2lw,Easy Guided Meditation For Manifesting Dreams ♥,12:40,531k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98L-kB8L2lw,"This quick and easy guided meditation is created to help you manifest all of your dreams and desires. 
🚨 Check out our NEW youtube channel dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditations 🚨 
@BohoBeautifulMeditation 

Our thoughts and words are very powerful and the moment we truly understand their power we will become more powerful designers of our own lives. In this guided meditation we are going to train our minds to bring more positivity and love to ourselves and the life that we live. 

Use this meditation anytime you feel lost, stressed or unsure of which direction to move your life in, or if you need to refocus and recharge your motivation- to give yourself clarity in your journey and to redefine your goals.  Always remember to follow your heart. Our mind and ego love to over analyze everything and to convince us of the ""safe path"", the decisions that will make everyone happy instead of yourself.

Through this meditation practice we train to pause the voice of the ego and hear the deeper voice within your soul. Your calling, your dreams, and your life goals. 

Live the life you love. Anything is possible. The decision starts with you. 

Oh and also!! This video introduces our little rottie gentlemen - Prince!

Boho Beautiful Yoga,MfYRSxAVBx4,Perfect Full Body Yoga ♥ Detox & Digestion Flow,20:02,10m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYRSxAVBx4,"This 20 min yoga class is intended to work your whole entire body with a great focus on helping your digestive system. As we incorporate many different twists into this class, it will not only help you with any stomach sensitivities but also leave you feeling refreshed and recharged.
 
Most twists directly affect the area below the ribcage where most digestion happens. Twists squeeze your liver which is your body's most important detox player which in return will fire up an internal cleanup of all the junk we consume. 

This is an amazing class to do along with some of our other fitness videos below. Try any of the fitness videos below first and then finish off with this 20 min yoga class and I promise it will leave you feeling cleansed and replenished!  XO

Boho Beautiful Yoga,X_WqIZD9mIM,Be The Change You Want To See In The World ♥ Elephant Haven (Elephant Nature Park),16:07,204k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_WqIZD9mIM,"Elephant Haven is part of the Elephant Nature Park organization based in Chang Mai, and although Elephant Haven was once a trekking camp providing tourists with elephant riding and entertainment, it has since been converted into a place where elephants can recover in peace and be elephants again. 

The business of people using Elephants to acquire easy tourist dollars is ugly, abusive, shameful, and unfortunately quite profitable… but places like Elephant Haven & Elephant Nature park serve both as sanctuaries for these animals and as necessary experiential education for tourists and animal lovers alike. They help shine a light on the need for us to reevaluate our relationships to this planet’s most wonderful creatures. 

Upon our jouney to Thailand, we had the great pleasure of spending a few days at Elephant Haven, and experienced what it takes to care for these amazing beings. From prepearing food, to feedings them, to walking, playing, and washing them, we even helped shovel & clean up their massive amounts of poop! There is no doubt that the people of any animal sanctuary have their hands full. Saving animals is not cheap. Even though its highly rewarding, Elephant Haven still has to compete against the existing Elephant Trekking Camps that continue to win over bussiness by offering rides, and all kinds of sad entertainment provided by bo-hooks and years of abuse and submission. 

In Thailand, in order to buy an elephant’s freedom the cost is approx $20,000 USD.  And after it acquires its freedom it only gets more expensive.  Food, shelter, vet bills, care-takers, up keeping facilities, and property for the elephants to roam lead to an endless amount of expenditures. And when putting the elephant to work is not an option to bring in revenue, sanctuaries rely on visitors and donations. 

So, we ask that you help in any way you can. Every single dollar is worth something to the people of Elephant Haven. So thank you. 

We believe that it is our duty to protect those in need and we've come to a point in our history where so many of our animal friends need the help of places like this.  We hope to raise enough money to provide Elephant Haven with even just a little more financial assistance as they continue to lead by example. 

We thank you for taking this time to watch the video, visit our gofundme page,  and contribute to the change we all wish to see upon our planet. Lets stand together as one and speak for the voiceless, they need us as much as we need them.

So we thought we'd put up a blog with an update and a few questions for you guys...

Although its going to be a hard goodbye for us, leaving this paradise lifestyle of morning surfing on Playa Hermosa, organic food in Santa Teresa, yoga at sunset, and the wonderful stray dog friends that follow us anywhere we go...we're looking forward to some of the benefits of summer in Toronto, Canada. Cottage season is always a good time and already planning to do some hiking and camping in beautiful Ontario. Plus its cherry season yey!!! ;) 

Hope you like the blog and seeing Mark in front of the camera for the first time with me! We had a great time shooting this for you guys at our favourite place in Surf Vista Villas.

Looking forward to reading your comments/suggestions and getting some video ideas. XO

Lots of love!!

Boho Beautiful Yoga,ICanFGTsW8c,Yin Yoga Class ♥ Best Yoga For Slow Deep Muscle Release,21:14,3.1m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICanFGTsW8c,"What is Yin Yoga?
Yin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.

Suitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.

Each posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. 

Yin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:

-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body
-Stress and anxiety reduction
-Increased circulation
-Improved flexibility
-Fascial release

This 20 min Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. Do this practice after a long day at work/school or after a vigorous workout. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. 

Relax, go deep, enjoy xo

Juliana

Boho Beautiful Yoga,UZ_xrAoi3vk,Best Yoga For The Heart ♥ Elephant Haven | Elephant Nature Park,21:11,505k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ_xrAoi3vk,"Elephant Haven is an elephant sanctuary in Kanchanaburi, Thailand.  It is part of a group of sanctuaries underneath the banner of Elephant Nature Park which is based out of Chaing Mai.  E.L.P. was established in the 1990’s to provide a sanctuary and rescue centre for elephants, cats, dogs, and many other wildlife. Elephants are not only an endangered species but also like so many other wonderful exotic creatures continue to endure abuse, cruelty, and mistreatment in order to provide human entertainment and generate easy tourism dollars. Horrible methods and tools are used in order to ""break"" these peaceful creatures, only to allow us to climb onto their backs, watch them do simple tricks, and even simply pose for photos. Thankfully more and more people are becoming aware of these mistreatments and sanctuaries such Elephant Nature Park/Elephant Haven are beginning to spring up more and more worldwide. And as normal elephant tourism parks are finding themselves under increasing scrutiny and controversy, it's forcing everyone involved to rethink our relationships with these beautiful creatures. The result of more sanctuaries, is that more sick & rescued elephants are finding the care they need and being given their freedom back so that they can live the rest of their lives out in the peaceful manner they originally deserved. 

How you can help:
- Educate yourself online. 
- Spread the word and speak out about the plight of all Elephants in anyway you can (be it about poachers, trophy hunters, or in this case as human entertainment). 
- Visit sanctuaries when you can, support them however you see fit, or simply tell people you know who are going to travel about the reasons for sanctuaries like the ones apart of Elephant Nature Park.  
- And if YOU are lucky enough to be going to Thailand, Elephant Nature Park offers day and volunteer trips in order to allow people to experience proper peaceful and kind interactions with elephants of all sizes and ages. 

Mark and I spent a few days volunteering, cleaning, feeding, and washing these peaceful giants in the River Kwai. Truly an unforgettable experience, as well as an extremely small yet rewarding contribution to the saving and care of these abused animals. We feel blessed to know that there are amazing people who work everyday at sanctuaries world wide for all types of animals...  the ones working diligently to give them back small pieces of all the things we humans have taken away.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While staying at Elephant Haven we filmed a yoga video we believed reflected the wonderful positive energy of compassion and kindness we were completely surrounded with at the Elephant Haven Sanctuary. 

This 20 min yoga flow is focused on rebalancing, centering, and strengthening your body and mind. We move through deep hip opening postures, deep breath work, and core strengthening postures to help you balance and centre your body. 

This is a great yoga flow to do anytime of the day when you feel like you are in need of rebalancing and recharging. Move, breath, stretch, and enjoy this peaceful elephant yoga flow with me on the edge of the famous River Kwai.

Remember...

When you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you ""do"" in life. But meditation is not a ""doing"", it is a ""being"". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. 

The trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go.  Meditation to me, and what I would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness.  

When you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. 
More than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. 

There are so many great benefits to meditation once you truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. 

Find a comfortable seated position, put some headphones on, relax, and allow yourself to let go and surrender into the now. 

Namaste. XO

The most perfect way to start your day! Get your body awake and ready to go. 

https://www.bohobeautiful.life
Many people wonder if starting your day with a hard workout or a yoga practice is better? Both exercise and practices are great and I would recommend if you have the time to do both (first workout then yoga). However, most of us don't have that amount of time therefore a great combination of yoga and strengthening exercises will be the best way to get those results you want.  

If you are looking to cure your morning fatigue, refocus your mind or wake up every muscle in your body to start your day, this is the perfect morning yoga class for you. 

Pair this morning yoga workout class with some of my other fitness videos to create an hour long full body workout! 

The following classes below would go great with this video:

I Dream...

Sometimes i dream of a world where this feeling lasts forever. 
Where we share the understanding that we are all in this together. 
Each one of us, here, right now, thinking… breathing…alive. 

This world is far from perfect. 
Yet love exists all around us. 
So let’s promise each other never to forget. 
Not to let this go. 
Even though we both know that we will. 

There is so much more to this. 

We don't need to hurt, each other, the creatures of our planet, the earth between our toes. 
It begins with a decision. 
The decision to chose love over fear. 
Compassion over self
To give instead of break. 
To understand that each of us is a canvas blank at the start…

And still sometimes i dream of silly things. 
Like humans living equal. And all the animals being unchained. 
And power ruling from our hearts. 
Instead of from institutions or all these borders drawn with crayons, or by the 1%.
Where we become the stewards, the protectors, and accept our throne that is still sadly sitting empty.

I dare you to wake up. 
Disconnect from all this noise. 
I dare you to look up at the sky and realize.Your existence. Purpose, your goals, and dreams. 
That you and me, and every choice we make can contribute to the change we need to see. 
Look into their eyes. 
Look into your own. 
 
There is so much more to this. 

I hope this feeling lasts forever.

♥ CHALLENGE GUIDELINES ♥

♥ Rest days include a yoga session so you can stretch those sore   
    muscles

♥ Drink at least 2 L of water per day through the challenge.

♥ Include at least one dark green leafy salad per day.

♥ Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. 

♥ And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean. I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire.

🚨 Check out our NEW youtube channel dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditations 🚨  
@BohoBeautifulMeditation 

This is day five of our meditation series and in this video we will be focusing on forgiveness. Forgiving ourselves and others and allowing this forgiveness to free ourselves from resentment, anger, sadness and regret. Accepting the present moment, accepting the past and making a choice to move on so new wonderful opportunities can flow into your lives. 

In meditation, one of the methods that helps anchor oursleves is focusing your mind on a specific mantra. The mantra becomes a wonderful tool to pull you back when your mind wanders and to allow your mind to explore the depths and emotions surrounding that idea at the same time. In this video I will be providing you with a mantra or centering thought for you to carry through your meditation and into the rest of your day. 

""I love, I forgive, I release"". 

When you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you ""do"" in life. But meditation is not a ""doing"", it is a ""being"". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. 

When you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time it will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. 
More than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. 

If you have ever wondered how to meditate? Or were curious about meditation challenges. Wanted to know how to breathe when mediating? How to clear your thoughts? How to bring more abundance and positivity into your life? This guided mediation will help. 

There are so many great benefits to meditation once you truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. 

Find a comfortable seated position, relax, and lets begin.

Namaste.

Being away from the internet and not being able to stay in touch with the outside world as much as we would like to has been a challenging and a wonderful experience at the same time. I wanted to share some of my thoughts here on the importance of digitally checking out. Putting our phones down, turning off social media and experiencing life through our own eyes and hearts. In addition, I wanted to introduce you to some awesome island puppies. 

Also, apologies for being a little slow with my responses. Trying my best to catch up with everyone over these next few days. :)

🚨 Check out our NEW youtube channel dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditations 🚨 https://flow.bohobeautiful.life/BohoBeautifulMind-

This is day three of our full meditation series and in this video we will be focusing on accepting each moment that you're in for what it is. Allowing ourselves to stop over-analyzing the past, worrying about the future, and truly learning to understand that the present moment is the only thing that is real and the only thing you can ever control. 

In meditation, one of the methods that helps anchor oursleves is focusing your mind on a specific mantra. The mantra becomes a wonderful tool to pull you back when your mind wanders and to allow your mind to explore the depths and emotions surrounding that idea at the same time. In this video I will be providing you with a mantra or centering thought for you to carry through your meditation and into the rest of your day:

""I am exactly where I need to be""

When you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you ""do"" in life. But meditation is not a ""doing"", it is a ""being"". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. 

The trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go. Meditation to me, and what i would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness. 

When you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time it will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. 
More than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance and you. 

There are so many great benefits to meditation once you truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, appreciate the simple things, and find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. 

Find a comfortable seated position, relax, and follow along on this peaceful and stress releasing mediation for beginners.

Namaste.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,_r6rMFUTSuI,"Full Nature Re-Charge ♥ Sandbanks Park, Canada",5:36,48k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r6rMFUTSuI,"Sometimes the life you want to live is on the other end of one singular decision. Sometimes breaking the rules and chasing a dream is the right move to make. We aren't meant to live in the boxes they have made for us. We arent meant to stare at digital screen and pixels all day long like the rest of them. There has to be so much more to all of this. On this rock, in this mystic wondrous universe, spinning around a burning ball of gas and laughing and smiling and wondering if anything amidst this beautiful madness will ever be figured out. When finding something you love to do is the first step to everything, finding someone you love to share it with... if even for a moment... is the singular star in your life's sky. 

We stayed in our home country Canada this summer and explored the beautiful surroundings like this Sandbanks Provincial Park in Picton, Ontario. We packed our car, took our gear and camping supplies and set of to shoot some videos. 

Travel, create memories, and see what the world has to offer. Life is too precious not to.

Taking 5 min out of your evening and winding down before bed time is one of the best ways to shut the mind off and allow your body to have the full rest it deserves. 

Turn the lights low, get into your pjs and take the next 5 min to let go and relax!

Boho Beautiful Yoga,S5BR75ySQOo,Guided Meditation For Gratitude ♥,11:12,635k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5BR75ySQOo,"This is a 10 minute guided meditation that is meant to help you start your day in a calm & loving way. 
🚨 Check out our NEW youtube channel dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditations 🚨 


This is day two of our full meditation series and in this video we will focus on gratitude and the manifestation of wonderful things into your life. 

In meditation, one of the methods that help us ground ourselves during and after practice  is focusing on a specific mantra. So in this video I will be providing you with a mantra to focus on during the meditation and to carry through the rest of your day. 

When you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you ""do"" in life. But meditation is not a ""doing"", it is a ""being"". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. 

The trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go. Meditation to me, and what i would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness. 

When you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time it will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. 
More than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. 

If you have ever wondered how to meditate? Or were curious about meditation challenges. Wanted to know how to breathe when mediating? How to clear your thoughts? How to bring more abundance and positivity into your life? This guided mediation will help. 

There are so many great benefits to meditation once you truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. 

Find a comfortable seated position, relax, and follow along on this peaceful and stress releasing mediation for beginners.

Namaste.

-If you want to get the splits, you must commit to working at it everyday.
-Other videos that claim you'll get the splits fast, risk injury and are impossible claims.

This is a 10 min yoga sequence that I've created for you that will target every muscle you need in order to achieve full leg flexibility. I want you guys to treat this as a 30 Day Challenge, where you will dedicate 10 min each day and practice these stretches. If you commit yourself to that, I promise you will be down in splits in no time. 

My 30 Day Challenge for you is to incorporate this video with my other yoga/fitness videos everyday. By working the muscles, getting them super warm and then going into deep stretches like the ones in the video, it will make your progress much quicker. 

Great videos to pair with:

In the midst of our video shoots for you guys we love experiencing as much of the world as possible. We did an amazing drive from Samara to Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica and hit up some amazing hidden gems that Costa Rica has to offer. An experience that is truly unforgettable. 

I know I say it a lot but seriously Costa Rica is my favourite place in the world. If you guys ever get the chance to check it out I highly recommend it. The energy, the people, and the nature will simply blow you away. 

Travel, create memories, and see what the world has to offer. Life is too precious not to.

I designed it to focus on your lower half: glutes, hamstrings, and core muscles/abs. It's crazy how often students or friends of mine admit that they don't stretch or wind down at the end of a workout when it really is a vital step for not only the safety but also the development of the muscles that you are targeting. Workout, stretch, lots of water, and clean eating. That's how you make the world go round!

♥ CHALLENGE GUIDELINES ♥
  
♥ Drink at least 2 L of water per day through the challenge.

♥ Always include this particular stretch video at the end of the workout: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IeS84sb3ZQ

♥ Include at least one dark green leafy salad per day. One of my favourite salad recipes:  http://ohsheglows.com/2013/11/25/the-best-shredded-kale-salad/

♥ Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. 

♥ And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean.  I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire. 


So enjoy the challenge, sweat tons, & don't hesitate to come to me with questions, for advice, and to please tell me your story & show me your results!

We met some great people, ate tons of healthy & amazing vegan food, and played with lots of dogs. And horses. And pigs. And Monkeys. ♥

Our favourite part about filming our videos, and creating the rest of our youtube channel are the adventures we share that come along with it. This is our second adventure vlog video where we want to capture a little of the behind the scenes and day to day work that goes into what we love to do. 

We hope you enjoy our wanderlust adventures, PLEASE like, comment or share if you enjoy!

♥PURA VIDA♥

On a final note:
The world we live in is a beautiful place, I can't emphasize enough how much I believe that we have to travel... not to escape life but to make sure life doesn't escape us. Its just that I don't believe in vacations, I believe in experiences. So get yourself out there and create some memories, see the world, and love deeply.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,5TvIdqigPk4,Meditation For Beginners ♥ Learn To Meditate,11:37,485k views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TvIdqigPk4,"This is an easy ten minute guided mediation for beginners. Please put some headphones on, find a comfortable place to sit, and then just listen to my voice.

https://flow.bohobeautiful.life/BohoBeautifulMind-

When you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you ""do"" in life. But meditation is not a ""doing"", it is a ""being"". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. 

The trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go.  Meditation to me, and what i would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness.  

When you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. 
More than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. 

If you have ever wondered how to meditate? Or wanted to know how to breathe when mediating? How to clear your thoughts? How to clear stress and anxiety from your day? This guided mediation will help. 

There are so many great benefits to meditation once u truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. 

Find a comfortable seated position, relax, and follow along on this peaceful and stress releasing mediation for beginners.

Namaste. 

Relax, Release and Let Go.

Boho Beautiful Yoga,oX6I6vs1EFs,Morning Yoga Workout ♥ Better Than The Gym | Strength & Stretch,17:10,30m views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6I6vs1EFs,"A 15 minute yoga workout class aimed to strengthen and to stretch your body. Perfect morning yoga to wakeup your body but also great anytime and almost anywhere. 

Many people ask what is the best workout to do when you wake up? Is a cardio workout or strength workout better in the morning?  

The best morning workout you can do to wake up your body is a combination of heart raising exercises, strength and mixing up stretching yoga poses throughout the workout. This 15 minute strength and stretch yoga class will do exactly that! It will get your heart rate up, get you sweating, working your abs, and stretching your shoulders, hamstrings, and upper body.

If you are looking to cure your morning fatigue, refocus your mind or wake up every muscle in your body to start your day, this is the perfect morning yoga class for you. 

Pair this morning yoga workout class with some of my other fitness videos to create an hour long full body workout!

Remember, if you want results you have to apply two rules and stick to them:
You have to work hard AND eat clean.

I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and i highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire. 

Enjoy and comment below to tell me how you feel afterwards. :)

We met some great people, ate tons of healthy & amazing vegan food, and played with lots of dogs. And horses. And pigs. And Monkeys. ♥

It's really exciting because some of you have been asking about tips on how to shoot your own fitness & yoga videos and this will show you that you just have to get out there and do it, just like we do. If you want to do something, the only thing holding you back is you!  

We hope you enjoy our wanderlust adventures, feel free to like, comment or share if you enjoy what you see. 

♥PURA VIDA♥

On a final note:
The world we live in is a beautiful place, I can't emphasize enough how much I believe that we have to travel... not to escape life but to make sure life doesn't escape us. Its just that I don't believe in vacations, I believe in experiences. So get yourself out there and create some memories, see the world, and love deeply.

Shot at Tabacon Hot Springs, in Arenal Costa Rica. 

Do you often feel overwhelmed and in need of relief? Are you constantly stressed and feeling anxiety? Have you ever wanted to learn how to meditate because you know the benefits of meditation would be perfect for your stressful daily life? 

Well this 10 min anxiety relief meditation practice is exactly what you need. It will allow you to let go of any anxieties, allow you to relax your mind, and even help you sleep better. Being grounded and finding a stillness in a chaotic modern day life is extremely important and valuable. A meditation video like will be perfect for you.  Its great for beginners and anyone who is experienced in meditation to quietly sit and breathe in the present moment. 

We often have such busy days that we don't take even 10 min to sit down and truly focus on our breath. We must find the peace within ourselves. Internally become aware of what is going on within. Closet your eyes and let go. Your soul needs it, your body craves it. The benefits of meditation are extremely powerful for your body. 

Restore your mind, calm your senses, and allow yourself to arrive in peace with everything that has been bothering you. Allow yourself to let go into your own state of silence. Listen to the calm relaxing nature sounds, music, and my voice, to then watch all trauma, stress, anxiety, melt into a perfectly balanced state of mind. 


Namaste. 

Relax, Release and Let Go.

Just relax, breathe deeply, and live in the moment of every stretch. You will see this routine can act as stress relief yoga too.

How Yoga Saved Me... or What I Learned From Yoga. 
By Juliana*

Take a deep breath. 
Sometimes you simply must let go. 
Release yourself into the unknown.
Who said you are supposed to have it figured out anyway. 
Maybe we truly never will.  
Maybe life is about living with each moment and daring to follow the unknown path. 
Maybe life is supposed to be about learning to surrender.
That everything will be revealed when its time for you to grow into the person you are meant to be. 

No one has the right to judge your life. 
You are always in control of the type of life you want to live and who you want to spend it with. 
Thats the beauty of being you. 
Maybe life is about appreciating what you have been given. 
And becoming better than who you already are.
Its about giving back into the universe
Through kindness and love to all that share this planet with us. 
Its about daring to be different. 
To stand up for what you believe. 
No matter how much resistance comes your way. 

Its about truly discovering your passion. 
Which will lead you to your purpose. 
Feeling the happiness and joy it brings you. 
The way it melts your heart and stops time while you are in it. 
To me that’s life. 

Don’t be afraid. 
Fear is not even real. 
Its always in your mind. 
And you are in control of it. 
Simply allow yourself to make a choice. 
Allow your heart to lead you where it needs to. 

So look up. And take a deep breath. 
Trust that all is taken care of by an energy far greater than you. 
Smile and trust the universe. 
Somehow it knows exactly what its doing.

Shot at Surf Villa Vistas, in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica.

This intermediate level yoga practice is here to strengthen those abs and stretch your body all at the same time. A lot of us always wonder how do you improve your sense of balance? What yoga exercises can you do to feel stronger? Im looking to advance my yoga practice for control of my body? We'll working your abs through a series of standing and seated yoga postures will definitely improve all of that! 

This is a great practice to do earlier in the day so you can feel balanced and energized for the rest of your day. Remember, don't worry if you can't get all the poses perfectly. Yoga is not about being perfect, its about what you learn on your journey through the entire process. Each pose will benefit you in different ways so allow yourself to feel completely content wherever you are in the pose at any given time. 

Stretch, Strengthen, and Enjoy!

@BohoBeautifulMeditation 

The wonders and power of taking the time in your day to meditate have been proven both spiritually and medically. Guided meditation makes it that much easier too.  Clearing and cleaning your mind of the day to day clutter is one of the most valuable experiences we can award to ourselves. It takes nothing more than finding the time and simply paying attention... and they say if you can't find five or ten minutes a day to meditate, then you need to find twenty. hah. 

If you've had a stressful day or are simply exhausted you need to include meditation and relaxation for your mind. Have you caught yourself wondering ""Which voice in my mind is really me?"", ""How can i meditate when my mind won't be silent?"", or simply ""I need help meditating""...  do you feel overwhelmed, and in need of something to ground you?  then this is the video for you. 

Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes and listen to my voice as I guide you through this 10 min meditation for relaxation. 

Don't worry if you find it frustrating in the search for stillness. Thats part of the journey too. We live in the most fast paced time the planet and humanity has ever seen, our minds are not used to slowing down to soak in the moment. But with some practice, a lot of breath monitoring, and persistence & patience, you will slowly realize there is a whole other side of life you have been missing. You. And this. Right here. Right now.

I Believe
by: Juliana & Mark

I believe in taking chances.
I believe that we were all brought here to find a passionate purpose. 
That we should appreciating the little things that matter most. 
I believe in being kind to all who share this land. 
That we are each fighting our own battles just trying to survive. 
In this new age of devices, time speeds up so we must learn to slow down.  

I believe that each of us has the power to become anything we  dream to be. 
I believe this is not an easy journey. 
but I believe in you. and that you believe in me.
 
I believe we are all still children but we were told to grow up.
That our 100 years isn't even a scratch. 
and maybe life shouldn't be taken so seriously. 
If we open up to possibility, dreams can always come true. 

I believe in watching sunsets. And in naming stars. 
And in thinking about this existence as a transient system that we are only a small part of. 
its like a bubble or a fog. One day forgotten. 
This is the beautiful nothingness.  

Maybe every day counts. Every decision we make. 
We can become better versions of ourselves.
I believe our choices today will define our tomorrow. Individually and as a planet. 

I believe in falling in love with ourselves and with you. Looking past the faults, insecurities, and in seeing the universe together as our beautiful creation. 
Its up to us how we chose to see it. 
Its our perception which becomes our reality. 

I believe in following your heart. No matter how much resistance we meet. 
I believe we each have the strength in us to evolve. 
That we are all beautiful. 
That we can do anything. 
And that the power of one, is enough to change the course. 
I believe in you.
